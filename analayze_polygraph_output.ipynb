         "Passage: A fair catch is a feature of American football and several other codes of football, in which a player attempting to catch a ball kicked by the opposing team -- either on a kickoff or punt -- is entitled to catch the ball without interference from any member of the kicking team. A ball caught in this manner becomes dead once caught, i.e., the player catching the ball is not entitled to run with the ball in an attempt to gain yardage, and the receiving team begins its drive at the spot where the ball was caught. A player wishing to make a fair catch signals his intent by extending one arm above his head and waving it while the kicked ball is in flight. The kicking team must allow the player an opportunity to make the catch without interference.\nQuestion: can you call fair catch on a kickoff",
