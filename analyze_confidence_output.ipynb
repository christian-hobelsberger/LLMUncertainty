Let me think. I remember that Robert Johnson is a famous blues musician, and he\\'s associated with the guitar Lucille. But wait, was he born in the US? I think he was born in Mississippi, which is in the US. But I\\'m not 100% sure. Another name that comes to mind is B.B. King, but I think his guitar is called Lucille too. Wait, no, B.B. King\\'s guitar is called Lucille, but was he born in the US? He was born in Mississippi as well, so that\\'s also in the US. Hmm, so maybe there are two possibilities here? But the question specifies a US-born musician. Wait, Robert Johnson was born in the US, right? He was born in Jackson, Mississippi. And he\\'s known for his guitar, which he named Lucille. But I\\'ve also heard that B.B. King\\'s guitar is called Lucille. Wait, maybe there\\'s confusion here. Let me check. Robert Johnson\\'s guitar was named Lucille, and he was born in the US. B.B. King also has a guitar named Lucille, but I think he got it from a woman named Lucille, but he was also born in the US. Wait, but the question is about a US-born blues musician. So both Robert Johnson and B.B. King are US-born. But the question is asking for which one. Maybe the answer is Robert Johnson, as he\\'s more famously associated with the name Lucille. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B.B. King. Wait, I think the answer is Robert Johnson. Because he\\'s the one who is most commonly linked with the Lucille guitar. But I\\'m not entirely sure. However, the question is about the US-born musician. Both are US-born. Wait, but maybe the answer is B.B. King. Wait, I need to recall. Let me think again. Robert Johnson was born in 1911 in Mississippi, USA. B.B. King was born in 1925 in Mississippi as well. Both are US-born. But which one\\'s guitar is called Lucille? Robert Johnson\\'s guitar was named Lucille, and B.B. King\\'s guitar is also named Lucille. So there\\'s a possibility that the answer is either. But the question is asking for the answer, so maybe the answer is Robert Johnson. But I\\'m not sure. Wait, perhaps the answer is B.B. King. Wait,'"
