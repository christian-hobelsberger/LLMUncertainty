Explanation:
Wi-Fi is a type of wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet without the need for physical cables. It uses radio waves to transmit data between devices, and is commonly used for internet access, online gaming, and streaming media. The use of Wi-Fi to connect to the internet is a common practice in many households and businesses, and is widely supported by most",wi-fi,90.0

An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits.

To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch.

## Step 1: Understand the concept of lossy audio encoding
Lossy audio encoding is a process that reduces the quality of an audio signal by discarding some of the audio data. This is done to save storage space, which is a common concern in digital media. Lossy audio encoding algorithms typically reduce the bit rate by discarding some of the audio data, which can lead to a decrease in sound quality.
