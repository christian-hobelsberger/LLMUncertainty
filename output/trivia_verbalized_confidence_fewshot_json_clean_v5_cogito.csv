Question: Which US born blues musician has a Gibson guitar called Lucille?","B.B. King

{""answer"": ""B.B. King"", ""confidence"": 100}B. B. King famously named his guitar Lucille after a significant incident in his early career when a fight at a venue led to a fire caused by a burning stove. He named it Lucille to remind him to avoid dangerous situations. This is well-documented in blues history and his biography, so I'm confident this is the correct answer. The question specifically asks for a US-born blues musician which fits B.B. King's credentials. The confidence is at 100 because this is a well-known fact about B.B. King's musical identity and history. However, I need to format it as a single-line JSON object as per the requirements. The response should have no markdown, no prose, no code blocks, just the JSON. The example for B.B. King would be: {""answer"": ""B.B. King"", ""confidence"": 100} Since you've already provided the answer, I just need to confirm the JSON format is correct. Yes, the answer is in the correct format. You've included the answer string ""B.B. King"" and the confidence score of 100 within a JSON object. The structure is accurate according to the specifications provided. No further adjustments are needed for this answer. The only requirement is to present it as a single-line JSON with two fields, which you've done correctly. The confidence score of 100 is appropriate given that this is a well-established historical fact about B.B. King's association with Lucille. There's no need to list alternatives or provide additional information, as per the guidelines. The answer is complete and meets all the specified criteria. Please proceed with the next question if there is one. If not, this answer is ready to be submitted as is. {""answer"": ""B.B.

The answer can be considered final and ready for submission. I've provided this response to ensure the final answer adheres to all guidelines. The single-line JSON object is properly formatted with the answer and confidence score, making it ready for use. No additional processing or formatting is required. {""answer"": ""B.B.
