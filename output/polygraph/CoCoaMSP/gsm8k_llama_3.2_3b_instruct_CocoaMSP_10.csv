A fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?,"The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

Question: A fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?
Answer:","$15.00
Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the watermelons.
The total cost of the watermelons is $80.

Step 2: Calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.
The profit percentage is 25%, so the selling price is 125% of the cost price.
Selling price = 125% of $80 = 1.25 * $80 = $100.

Step 3: Calculate the selling price of each watermelon.
The total number of watermelons is 50.
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Total number of watermelons
= $100 / 50
= $2.00

How many bottles of water are remaining in Samira's box?
Answer:","28
Explanation: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of water bottles Samira has initially. Since she has four dozen water bottles, we need to convert dozen to the number of bottles. 
One dozen is equal to 12. 
So, four dozen water bottles is 4 * 12 = 48 bottles.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles taken by the players during the game. 
In the first break, 11 players take 2 bottles each, so they take 11 * 2 = 22 bottles. 
At the end of the game, each player takes 1 more bottle, so they take 11 * 1 = 11 bottles. 
Total bottles taken by the players is 22 + 11 = 33 bottles.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bottles remaining in Samira's box. 
Total bottles initially = 48
Total bottles taken by the players = 33
Remaining bottles = Total bottles initially - Total bottles taken by the players
= 48 - 33

How much did Celina spend in total on the above-mentioned equipment?
Answer:","$[answer].


## Step 1: Calculate the cost of the flashlight
The cost of the flashlight is 20% of the cost of the hoodie. The hoodie costs $80, so the flashlight costs 0.20 * 80 = $16.

Answer:","Step 1: Calculate the cost of the chicken.
1.5 pounds of chicken at $6.00 per pound is 1.5 x 6 = $9.00.

Question: Susan had a sum of money. She spent 1/5 of it in September, 1/4 of it in October, and $120 in November. After spending these amounts of money, she still had $540 left. How much money did she have at first?
Answer:","$x$


## Step 1: Let's denote the initial amount of money Susan had as $x$.
We need to express the amounts she spent in terms of $x$.

## Step 2: Susan spent 1/5 of her money in September.
The amount she spent in September is $\frac{1}{5}x$.

## Step 3: Susan spent 1/4 of her money in October.
The amount she spent in October is $\frac{1}{4}x$.

## Step 4: Susan spent $120 in November.
This is a fixed amount and does not depend on $x$.

## Step 5: After spending these amounts of money, she still had $540 left.
So, the equation representing the situation is $x - \frac{1}{5}x - \frac{1}{4}x - 120 = 540$.

## Step 6: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms to get $x - \frac{4}{20}x - \frac{5}{20}x - 120 = 540$.

## Step 7: Further simplify the equation.
Combine the fractions to get $x - \frac{9}{20}x - 120 = 540$.

## Step 8: Combine like terms.
This simplifies to $\frac{11}{20}x - 120 = 540$.

## Step 9: Add 120 to both sides of the equation.
This gives $\frac{11}{20}x = 660$.

## Step 10: Multiply both sides by 20 to get rid of the fraction.
This gives $11x = 13200$.

## Step 11: Divide both sides by 11 to solve for $x$.
This gives $x = 1200$.
