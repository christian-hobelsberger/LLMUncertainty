Passage: The African lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat species that inhabits savannas and grasslands in sub-Saharan Africa. The largest species of the genus Panthera, the lion is characterized by its distinctive mane, which can grow up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and weigh up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms). The lion's diet consists mainly of large ungulates, such as zebras, antelopes, and wildebeests. It is a social animal, living in prides with a complex social hierarchy. The lion's roar is one of the loudest animal vocalizations, capable of being heard up to 5 miles (8 kilometers) away. The lion's lifespan is typically between 12 to 16 years in the wild, although it can live up to 18 years in captivity. The lion is considered a keystone species, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of its ecosystem. However, the lion is threatened by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the lion and its habitat.

If the repetend is a zero, this decimal representation is called a terminating decimal rather than a repeating decimal, since the zeros can be omitted and the decimal terminates before these zeros.

In contrast, the textile industry experienced a surge in demand due to the increased demand for clothing. The Great Depression was also a time of great hardship and suffering for many people, particularly in the United States. It was also a time of great innovation and reform in the field of economics. The government responded to the crisis by implementing a series of policies, including the creation of the Federal Reserve System and the establishment of the National Recovery Administration. The Great Depression was a significant event in American history, and it had a lasting impact on the country's economy and society.

Passage: The MediaWiki software, which drives Wikipedia, allows the use of a subset of HTML5 elements, or tags and their attributes, for presentation formatting. But most HTML can be included by using equivalent wiki markup or templates; these are generally preferred within articles, as they are sometimes simpler for most editors and less intrusive in the editing window; but Wikipedia's Manual of Style recommends their use in certain cases.

Passage: Holby City was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama Casualty, which is set in the emergency department of the fictional Holby City Hospital. Young wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in Casualty once they were taken away to the hospital's surgical wards. While Casualty's scope is limited to ``accident of the week'' storylines about patients entering hospital, Holby City allowed the possibility of storylines about long-term care, rather than immediate life and death decisions. The series was commissioned by BBC One Controller Peter Salmon, and began airing on BBC One on 12 January 1999.

do male and female red pandas look the same,Red panda,True,"The head and body length of a red panda measures 50 to 64 cm (20 to 25 in), and its tail is 28 to 59 cm (11 to 23 in). Males weigh 3.7 to 6.2 kg (8.2 to 13.7 lb) and females 3 to 6.0 kg (6.6 to 13.2 lb).

The light face has white badges similar to those of a raccoon, but each individual can have distinctive markings. Their roundish heads have medium-sized upright ears, black noses, and blackish eyes.

The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens, who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position. Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl, including franchise relocations and renaming: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1964) and Lions (1957) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl.

can you use other colors for a green screen,Chroma key,True,"Chroma key compositing, or chroma keying, is a visual effects/post-production technique for compositing (layering) two images or video streams together based on color hues (chroma range). The technique has been used heavily in many fields to remove a background from the subject of a photo or video -- particularly the newscasting, motion picture and videogame industries.

does passive transport go against the concentration gradient,Passive transport,False,"Diffusion is the net movement of material from an area of high concentration to an area with lower concentration. The difference of concentration between the two areas is often termed as the concentration gradient, and diffusion will continue until this gradient has been eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, it is described as moving solutes ``down the concentration gradient'' (compared with active transport, which often moves material from area of low concentration to area of higher concentration, and therefore referred to as moving the material ``against the concentration gradient''). However, in many cases (e.g. passive drug transport) the driving force of passive transport can not be simplified to the concentration gradient. If there are different solutions at the two sides of the membrane with different equilibrium solubility of the drug, the difference in degree of saturation is the driving force of passive membrane transport. It is also true for supersaturated solutions which are more and more important owing to the spreading of the application of amorphous solid dispersions for drug bioavailability enhancement.","Diffusion is the net movement of material from an area of high concentration to an area with lower concentration.

is moment of inertia the same as rotational inertia,Moment of inertia,True,"The moment of inertia, otherwise known as the angular mass or rotational inertia, of a rigid body is a tensor that determines the torque needed for a desired angular acceleration about a rotational axis; similar to how mass determines the force needed for a desired acceleration. It depends on the body's mass distribution and the axis chosen, with larger moments requiring more torque to change the body's rotation. It is an extensive (additive) property: for a point mass the moment of inertia is just the mass times the square of distance to the rotation axis. The moment of inertia of a rigid composite system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems (all taken about the same axis). Its simplest definition is the second moment of mass with respect to distance from an axis. For bodies constrained to rotate in a plane, only their moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the plane, a scalar value, matters. For bodies free to rotate in three dimensions, their moments can be described by a symmetric 3 × 3 matrix, with a set of mutually perpendicular principal axes for which this matrix is diagonal and torques around the axes act independently of each other.","The moment of inertia, otherwise known as the angular mass or rotational inertia, of a rigid body is a tensor that determines the torque needed for a desired angular acceleration about a rotational axis; similar to how mass determines the force needed for a desired acceleration.

Depending on the species, there can be either a single mother queen, or potentially, hundreds of fertile queens in some species. Queen ants have one of the longest life-spans of any known insect -- up to 30 years.

were all the bodies recovered from operation red wings,Operation Red Wings,True,"After the broken transmission from the SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team, the position and situation of the SEALs became unknown. Members of SEAL Team 10, U.S. Marines, and aviators of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment were prepared to dispatch a quick reaction force, but command for launch from higher special operations headquarters was delayed for a number of hours. A quick reaction force finally launched, consisting of two MH-47 Special Operations Aircraft of the 160th, two UH-60 conventional Army aviation Black Hawk helicopters, and two AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The two MH-47s took the lead. Upon reaching Sawtalo Sar, the two MH-47s received small arms fire. During an attempt to insert SEALs who were riding in one of the MH-47 helicopters, one of Ahmad Shah's men fired an RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade, which struck the transmission below the rear rotor assembly, causing the aircraft to immediately plummet to the ground, killing all eight 160th Army Special Operations Aviators and crew, and all eight Navy SEALs who were passengers. Both commanders of the 160th, Ground commander LCDR Erik S. Kristensen, of SEAL Team 10, and aviation element commander Major Stephen C. Reich, were killed in the shootdown.

Passage: The use of assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), is not a solution to the problems of infertility. It is a complex issue that involves a combination of medical, psychological, social, and environmental factors. The use of IVF is often based on a woman's age, and the age of the woman is a major factor in the success of the procedure. However, the success rate of IVF is not only dependent on the age of the woman but also on the quality of the egg and sperm. A woman's age is just one of many factors that can affect the outcome of the procedure. Furthermore, the age of the woman has a significant impact on the woman's body and the environment in which she lives, and it is this impact that can affect the success of the procedure. Therefore, a woman's age is a major factor in the success of the procedure, and it is essential to consider it when making decisions about fertility treatment.

is any part of the white house original,White House,True,"Decades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for Harry S. Truman took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame. By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at Blair House from 1949 to 1951. The work, done by the firm of Philadelphia contractor John McShain, required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure. The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7 million (US$54 million in 2018). Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall. Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter. The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952. While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814--1816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawed into paneling; the walls of the Vermeil Room, Library, China Room, and Map Room on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.","Decades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for Harry S.

Passage: The story of the Pilgrims, who settled in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620, is one of the most well-known tales of early American colonization. The group, led by William Bradford, had a tumultuous relationship with the Native American tribes they encountered, including the Wampanoag. The Wampanoag were a powerful and feared tribe, and the Pilgrims were eventually forced to flee to a nearby island after a devastating winter, where they spent the next 11 years in captivity. The Wampanoag, however, were not entirely hostile towards the Pilgrims. In fact, they played a significant role in the early years of the colony, serving as guides and mentors to the settlers. The Wampanoag helped the Pilgrims adapt to their new environment and taught them how to farm and hunt. As the years went by, the relationship between the two groups slowly improved, and by the 1650s, the Wampanoag had become an integral part of the colony. The Wampanoag continued to thrive and prosper, and the colony of Massachusetts became a thriving and prosperous state. The Wampanoag legacy can still be seen today, in the many cultural and historical sites throughout the region. The Wampanoag people are a proud and resilient tribe",true,80.0

Therefore, it is possible for a person to be nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other.

do you have to be born with perfect pitch,Absolute pitch,False,"Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be different from that of a non-absolute listener. Rather, ``it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing.'' Absolute pitch is an act of cognition, needing memory of the frequency, a label for the frequency (such as ``B-flat''), and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label. Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing colors, phonemes (speech sounds), or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color blue by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as light, it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C. Absolute pitch may also be related to certain genes, possibly an autosomal dominant genetic trait, though it ``might be nothing more than a general human capacity whose expression is strongly biased by the level and type of exposure to music that people experience in a given culture.''","Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be different from that of a non-absolute listener.

Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film was based on a real romance.

does the amazon river run through the amazon rainforest,Amazon River,True,"There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed large towns and cities. Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon. These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. In order to achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as terra preta de índio (``Indian dark earth''). Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.","There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed large towns and cities.

Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as terra preta de índio (``Indian dark earth''). Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures.

Passage: There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed large towns and cities. Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon. These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. In order to achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire.

Passage: State level laws vary significantly in their form, content, and level of restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.

Passage: The discovery of oil on the North Sea and the subsequent growth of the offshore oil industry in the UK has had a profound impact on the country's economy, leading to significant changes in the way people live and work. The industry has created new jobs and industries, but it has also raised concerns about the environmental impact of the extraction process. The government has introduced regulations to mitigate this impact, such as the ban on drilling in certain areas and the creation of protected areas for marine conservation. The industry's growth has also led to increased public awareness and engagement with environmental issues. However, the industry's reliance on fossil fuels has been criticized by some environmentalists, who argue that it perpetuates a cycle of consumption and waste. The UK's carbon emissions have increased significantly since the 1980s, and the industry's impact on the environment is still being felt today. The government has set targets to reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of renewable energy sources, but the industry's growth continues to pose challenges to these efforts.

was mercury used as a cure for syphilis,History of syphilis,True,"Mercury was a common, long-standing treatment for syphilis, and its use as such has been suggested to date back to The Canon of Medicine (1025) by the Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna); although this is only possible if syphilis existed in the Old World prior to Columbus (see § Origin). One of the first supporters of mercury treatment was Paracelsus because it had positive effects on the Arabic treatment of leprosy, which was thought to be a disease related to syphilis. Giorgio Sommariva of Verona is recorded to have used mercury to treat syphilis in 1496, and is often recognized as the first physician to have done so, although he may not have been a physician. During the sixteenth century, mercury was administered to syphilitic patients in various ways, including by rubbing it on the skin, by applying a plaster, and by mouth. A ``Fumigation'' method of administering mercury was also used, in which mercury was vaporized over a fire and the patients were exposed to the resulting steam, either by being placed in a bottomless seat over the hot coals, or by having their entire bodies except for the head enclosed in a box (called a ``tabernacle'') that received the steam. The goal of mercury treatment was to cause the patient to salivate, which was thought to expel the disease. Unpleasant side effects of mercury treatment included gum ulcers and loose teeth. Mercury continued to be used in syphilis treatment for centuries; an 1869 article by TJ Walker discussed administering mercury by injection for this purpose.","Mercury was a common, long-standing treatment for syphilis, and its use as such has been suggested to date back to The Canon of Medicine (1025) by the Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna); although this is only possible if syphilis existed in the Old World prior to Columbus (see § Origin).

is there a luxury tax in the united states,Luxury tax,False,"In November 1991, The United States Congress enacted a luxury tax and was signed by the former President George H.W. Bush. The goal of the tax was to generate additional revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit. This tax was levied on material goods such as watches, expensive furs, boats, yachts, private jet planes, jewelry and expensive cars. Congress enacted a 10 percent luxury surcharge tax on boats over $100,000, cars over $30,000, aircraft over $250,000, and furs and jewelry over $10,000. The federal government estimated that it would raise $9 billion in excess revenues over the following five-year period. However, only two years after its imposition, in August 1993, the Congress decided to eliminate the ``luxury tax'' since it did not achieve its main objective. It is noteworthy that it ``failed'' by only raising $8.9 billion--that is, it fell $97 million short of its projected revenue. According to the tax's critics, these revenues were disappointing and unsatisfactory and also negatively impacted the incomes of the sellers of the luxury items.

can rna exist in a variety of secondary structures,Nucleic acid secondary structure,True,"In molecular biology, two nucleotides on opposite complementary DNA or RNA strands that are connected via hydrogen bonds are called a base pair (often abbreviated bp). In the canonical Watson-Crick base pairing, adenine (A) forms a base pair with thymine (T) and guanine (G) forms one with cytosine (C) in DNA. In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U). Alternate hydrogen bonding patterns, such as the wobble base pair and Hoogsteen base pair, also occur--particularly in RNA--giving rise to complex and functional tertiary structures. Importantly, pairing is the mechanism by which codons on messenger RNA molecules are recognized by anticodons on transfer RNA during protein translation. Some DNA- or RNA-binding enzymes can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes. Hydrogen bonding is the chemical mechanism that underlies the base-pairing rules described above. Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the ``right'' pairs to form stably. DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low GC-content, but contrary to popular belief, the hydrogen bonds do not stabilize the DNA significantly and stabilization is mainly due to stacking interactions.","In molecular biology, two nucleotides on opposite complementary DNA or RNA strands that are connected via hydrogen bonds are called a base pair (often abbreviated bp).

Passage: In molecular biology, two nucleotides on opposite complementary DNA or RNA strands that are connected via hydrogen bonds are called a base pair (often abbreviated bp). In the canonical Watson-Crick base pairing, adenine (A) forms a base pair with thymine (T) and guanine (G) forms one with cytosine (C) in DNA. In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U). Alternate hydrogen bonding patterns, such as the wobble base pair and Hoogsteen base pair, also occur--particularly in RNA--giving rise to complex and functional tertiary structures. Importantly, pairing is the mechanism by which codons on messenger RNA molecules are recognized by anticodons on transfer RNA during protein translation.

do you need a permit to open carry in nc,Gun laws in North Carolina,False,"Open carry is also legal throughout North Carolina. In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with ``carrying a concealed weapon'' and ``carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because ``the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol. Although, the case of State v. Kerner helped/made more clear the allowance of openly carrying a pistol, it does not preclude all regulations regarding the carrying of firearms.","Open carry is also legal throughout North Carolina.

Passage: The majority opinion in the case of State v. Kerner (1921) was based on the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms. The Second Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights, which is a collection of amendments to the United States Constitution. The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. The Second Amendment states that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed, but it does not specify what ""bearing arms"" means. This is a matter of interpretation and is left to the states. In the case of State v. Kerner, the court applied a technical interpretation of the Second Amendment, which allowed the defendant to be charged with carrying a concealed weapon. The court also held that the defendant's actions, which were deemed to be a ""clear and present danger,"" were sufficient to justify the seizure of the defendant's gun. This ruling was based on the idea that the Second Amendment protects the right to own a gun, but does not guarantee that it will always be allowed. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Second Amendment only protects the right to own a gun, not to use it. In the case of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court further clarified that the Second Amendment protects not only the right to bear arms, but also the right to use them. The court held that the Second Amendment guarantees the right",False,90.0

can you have dual citizenship in us and haiti,History of Haitian nationality and citizenship,False,"In recent years, there has been discussion about a constitutional amendment to change Haiti's stance against dual nationality; yet while feelings have begun to lean towards acceptance of dual citizenship, policy has yet to change. Legally, the 1987 constitution still stands, which states, ``Dual Haitian and foreign nationality is in no case permitted.''

TNT's primary asset is its remarkable insensitivity and stability: a full generation better than Dynamite, it is waterproof and incapable of detonating without the extreme shock and heat provided by a blasting cap (or a sympathetic detonation); this conveniently also allows it to be melted at 178 °F, poured into high explosive shells and allowed to re-solidify with no extra danger or change in the TNT's characteristics. As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, hand grenades and aerial bombs and the remainder being packaged in brown ``bricks'' (not red cylinders) for use as demolition charges by combat engineers.","In actuality, aside from both being high explosives, TNT and Dynamite have very little in common: TNT is a 2nd generation castable explosive adopted by the military a full sixty years after Dynamite, which is a 1st generation phlegmatized explosive primarily intended for civilian earthmoving.

Passage: Proteins are the basic building blocks of cells. They carry out specific functions, such as catalyzing chemical reactions, transmitting signals, and regulating the cell's internal environment. Proteins are composed of amino acids and are formed through a series of chemical reactions. The process of protein synthesis is unique and involves the use of ribosomes, which read the genetic code contained in the DNA. Proteins have unique properties, such as size, shape, and function, which allow them to perform their specific functions.

Passage: In the early 1900s, the United States was a major producer of fish and seafood, but in the 1970s, the commercial fishing industry began to decline. Many fishermen and their families lost their livelihoods, and the industry was forced to close down. As a result, the fish and seafood industry was left with a surplus of fish and seafood. This surplus led to a decrease in the prices of these products, making them more affordable for the general public. The government responded to this surplus by implementing policies that restricted the export of fish and seafood from the United States, and by imposing tariffs on imported seafood. This move helped to reduce the price of fish and seafood, but it also led to increased unemployment among fishermen and their families. The government's response to the surplus was seen as a failure by some, and it was criticized for being too costly and restrictive. Critics argued that the government's policies did not address the underlying issues and that they only made things worse. They also pointed out that the government's policies led to the closure of many small and medium-sized fishing businesses, which were not able to compete with the large fishing companies that were allowed to export their products. This led to the decline of many fishing communities and the loss of jobs for fishermen and their families. 

Question: did the government's policies reduce the price of fish and seafood in the United States?

did my name is earl finish his list,My Name Is Earl,False,"I had always had an ending to Earl and I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to see it happen.

Passage: The 17th-century French diplomat and historian Jean-Baptiste Colbert created the first French naval academy in 1667. He also established the first modern fleet of warships, which included the famous ship of war, the Gueux, which was later renamed the Général Grouchy. Colbert's policies and reforms helped to modernize the French navy and increase its power. The French navy played a significant role in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) and the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783). In 1884, the French navy was reorganized into three fleets: the Atlantic Fleet, the Mediterranean Fleet, and the Baltic Fleet.

is carrying capacity the same for all species,Carrying capacity,False,"Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it. Later, the idea was expanded to more complex populations, like humans. For the human population, more complex variables such as sanitation and medical care are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment. As population density increases, birth rate often increases and death rate typically decreases. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the ``natural increase''. The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase. Thus, the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment. Below carrying capacity, populations typically increase, while above, they typically decrease. A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a regulating factor. Population size decreases above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the species concerned, but can include insufficient space, food supply, or sunlight. The carrying capacity of an environment may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including: food availability, water supply, environmental conditions and living space. The origins of the term ``carrying capacity'' are uncertain, with researchers variously stating that it was used ``in the context of international shipping'' or that it was first used during 19th-century laboratory experiments with micro-organisms. A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the US Secretary of State to the US Senate.","Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it.

the actors in the courtroom work group typically cooperate with one another,Courtroom Workgroup,True,"Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works, it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants. The academic theory of the courtroom workgroup has four cornerstone concepts that recognize this fact: Speed, Pragmatic Cynicism, Collegiality, and Secrecy. Efficient courtroom workgroups seek to process cases rather than dispense justice. This has been confirmed to greater and lesser extents in different courts. Defendants are assumed to be guilty. The procedural merits of the case are the true determinative factors of an outcome. Prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in a comparison of charges against possible procedural flaws and possible defenses to arrive at the going rate for a crime. These factors are used to determine how much punishment the plea bargain will offer. For example, group relationships and the desire to ``maintain'' a healthy working relationship are important to group members. The workings of the courtroom group and the ``going rate'' for given crimes are not matters for public disclosure. Estimates can be given to clients, but usually couched in terms of the prosecution's willingness to negotiate.

Passage: Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works, it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants.

Passage: The concept of zero is a fundamental idea in mathematics and science. It represents the absence of quantity, and it is the starting point for all mathematical operations and scientific calculations. The number zero has a rich history, with evidence of its use dating back to ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Mayans. Zero is also an important concept in computer science, where it is used as a placeholder in programming languages. The use of zero as a placeholder is often seen as a symbol of elegance and simplicity. In many cultures, zero is considered a sacred number, representing the unity of all things. In some cultures, it is also associated with the concept of nothingness.

is it possible to have a supercharger and turbo,Twincharger,True,"Twincharger refers to a compound forced induction system used on some piston-type internal combustion engines.

When combined with a large turbocharger -- if the ``turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the low-rpm range -- the proper combination of the two can offer a zero-lag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end.

Passage: The Metro Purple Line is a 6.4-mile (10.3 km) line that begins at Union Station. At Union Station, passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line bus rapid transit line, and the Metro Gold Line. The Purple Line travels southwest through Downtown Los Angeles, passing the Civic Center, Pershing Square (near the Historic Core) and the Financial District. Passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line (both directions) at Civic Center Station. At Pershing Square Station, passengers can board the northbound Metro Silver Line bus at Olive Street/5th Street. At 7th St/Metro Center Station, travelers can connect to the Metro Blue Line, Metro Expo Line and the Metro Silver Line. From here, the train travels between 7th Street and Wilshire Boulevard (and briefly Ingraham Street) west through Pico-Union and Westlake, arriving at Wilshire/Vermont in the city's Mid-Wilshire/Koreatown district.

{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 100} 

Passage: Carbon steel, also known as steel containing a small percentage of carbon, has a wide range of applications. It can be made from various types of steel, including mild steel, low-carbon steel, and stainless steel. Carbon steel is strong and tough, but not readily tempered, meaning it can be easily deformed and then quenched and tempered to obtain a desired microstructure. Carbon steel has a relatively high tensile strength, but its low ductility makes it prone to cracking in the presence of stress.
Question: is carbon steel the same as mild steel? 

{""answer"": ""No"", ""confidence"": 80} 

Passage: Carbon steel is a very common material used in construction, transportation, and other industries due to its strength, toughness, and relatively low cost. It is a versatile material that can be used to make various products, such as pipes, sheets, and beams. Carbon steel has a relatively low carbon content, which allows it to be easily alloyed with other elements to increase its strength and properties. Carbon steel is often used in applications where high strength and toughness are required, such as in the manufacture of heavy machinery and equipment.

can a young person die of natural causes,Death by natural causes,True,"A death by natural causes, as recorded by coroners and on death certificates and associated documents, is the end result of an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, typically due to old age. This is especially true when an elderly person has several different conditions or diseases, but where it appears that none of them alone or together may clearly lead to the death, and it is uncertain which condition was the final factor causing death. Contrary to the statement before, everything is natural at some point. For example, a person dying from complications from influenza (an infection) or a heart attack (an internal body malfunction) or sudden heart failure would be listed as having died from natural causes. Health departments discourage listing old age as the cause of death because doing so does not benefit public health or medical research. Old age is not a scientifically recognized cause of death; there is always a more direct cause, although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of aging-associated diseases.","A death by natural causes, as recorded by coroners and on death certificates and associated documents, is the end result of an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly caused by external forces, typically due to old age.

Question: can a young person die of natural causes","? Yes
Confidence: 90

Passage: A person's age is a major factor in determining their lifespan, as younger people tend to live longer than older individuals. This is due to a combination of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and access to medical care. For instance, older adults may be more likely to have chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which can affect their lifespan. However, in some cases, a person's lifespan can be significantly shortened by a rare and unexpected event, such as a heart attack or a stroke. In these cases, the person's age may be cited as the cause of death, even if the underlying condition was not directly caused by the event. For example, a 25-year-old man who dies of a heart attack at the age of 35 is cited as having died of natural causes, although it is likely that the heart attack was a contributing factor to his death. The decision to list a person's age as the cause of death is typically made by a coroner or other medical professional. They will consider various factors, including the person's medical history, lifestyle, and access to medical care, when making this decision.

does a point guard have to be tall,Point guard,False,"Among the taller players who have enjoyed success at the position is Ben Simmons, who at 6' 10'' won the 2018 National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year Award. Behind him is Magic Johnson, who at 6' 9'' (2.06 m) won the National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award three times in his career. Other point guards who have been named NBA MVP include Russell Westbrook, Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Allen Iverson, Derrick Rose and two-time winners Steve Nash and Stephen Curry. In the NBA, point guards are usually about 6' 3'' (1.93 m) or shorter, and average about 6' 2'' (1.88 m) whereas in the WNBA, point guards are usually 5' 9'' (1.75 m) or shorter. Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness, and ball handling skills. Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor, and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling.","Among the taller players who have enjoyed success at the position is Ben Simmons, who at 6' 10'' won the 2018 National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year Award.
