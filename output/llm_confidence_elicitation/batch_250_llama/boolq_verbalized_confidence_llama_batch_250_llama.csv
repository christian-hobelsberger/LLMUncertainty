Question: are there any of the temptations still living","today?

**Answer:** False
**Confidence:** 90

I am a young and ambitious aspiring journalist, and I am writing a profile on the members of the Temptations. I had heard that Williams was the only surviving member of the group, but I was excited to learn more about his life and career. However, after conducting some research, I found that I was incorrect. According to various sources, including the Temptations' official website and other reliable sources, there are still several members of the group alive today. I was particularly surprised to learn that Melvin Franklin, who was a key member of the group and a close friend of Williams, is still living. I also found out that the Temptations' original bass singer, Eddie Kendricks, passed away in 2004, but the group's current bass singer, Otis Williams, continues to perform and record with the group. I am impressed by the group's enduring legacy and their ability to continue performing and recording music to this day.",,

This passage provides a good account of the Vijayanagara Empire's history, but it does not accurately represent the story of the two brothers who founded the empire. The passage states that the empire was established by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of the Sangama Dynasty, but it does not mention that the brothers were the same person. The passage also states that the empire lasted until 1646, but it does not provide any information about the brothers' eventual fate. The passage also states that the kingdom was named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India, which is true. The passage provides some information about the writings of medieval European travelers and the literature in local languages, which is also true. The passage's accuracy is therefore 75%.

Passage: A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in; if a player throws the ball directly into their own goal without any other player touching it, the result is a corner kick to the opposing side. Likewise an offensive goal cannot be scored directly from a throw in; the result in this case is a goal kick for the defending team.
Question: does a goal from a throw in count","as an offensive goal?

## Step 1: Analyze the rules of the game
According to the passage, a goal from a throw in does not count as an offensive goal. This implies that the rules of the game dictate that a goal can only be scored from a throw-in or a corner kick.

## Step 2: Determine the answer based on the rules
Since a goal from a throw-in or a corner kick is not an offensive goal, the correct answer to the question is ""False"".

## Step 3: Calculate the confidence score
Based on the analysis, the confidence score is 0, since the rules of the game clearly state that a goal from a throw-in or a corner kick is not an offensive goal.

Question: did the uk have a referendum to join the eu","after the 1974 election?

Answer: True, and the answer is 'True'. Confidence score: 80

Explanation:
The UK held a referendum on 5 June 1975 to determine its future relationship with the European Communities. The question was phrased as ""Do you want the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Communities?"" The result was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EC. The 1974 general election manifesto had promised to allow the people to decide on the UK's future membership. The 1975 referendum confirmed this promise, with 67% of voters supporting the continuation of UK membership in the EC. Therefore, the UK did indeed hold a referendum on joining the EU.",,

{""answer"": False, ""confidence"": 80}

This is a good question, but the passage is not clear about the relationship between Isle of Man money and Bank of England notes. In the UK, Bank of England notes are generally considered legal tender, but the Isle of Man has its own currency, the Manx pound, which is not backed by the Bank of England. Therefore, Isle of Man money is not legal tender in the UK.

This response is too absolute. The passage mentions that the Isle of Man has decided to make UK currency legal tender on the island, but it does not specify whether the Isle of Man money is backed by the Bank of England. It is possible that the Isle of Man money is not backed by the Bank of England, but the passage does not provide sufficient information to determine this.

Confidence: 60
````
{""answer"": False, ""confidence"": 60}

This response is not confident enough.

Without more information, it is impossible to determine whether Isle of Man money is legal tender in the UK.

Passage: Like all other overseas American cemeteries in France for World War I and II, France has granted the United States a special, perpetual concession to the land occupied by the cemetery, free of any charge or any tax to honor the forces. This cemetery is managed by the American Battle Monuments Commission, a small independent agency of the U.S. federal government, under Congressional acts that provide yearly financial support for maintaining them, with most military and civil personnel employed abroad. The U.S. flag flies over these granted soils.
Question: is the american cemetery in normandy on american soil","?

Answer: False, 0%

 Confidence: 80

Explanation:
The American cemetery in Normandy is located on a piece of land that was occupied by the German army during World War II. The land is not ""on American soil"" as the U.S. flag is flown over it, indicating that the cemetery is not in the United States. The cemetery is managed by the American Battle Monuments Commission and is not a part of the U.S. federal government. Therefore, the answer is False. The confidence score of 80 reflects the speaker's confidence in the accuracy of the statement.",,

Passage: In the context of object-oriented programming, inheritance is a fundamental concept that enables developers to create classes based on a base class or parent class. The base class is responsible for providing the common attributes and methods, while the derived class inherits these attributes and methods and adds its own specific attributes and methods. Inheritance is used to promote code reuse, reduce code duplication, and improve the maintainability of the codebase.

Question: Can a class be inherited from more than one base class in a single inheritance hierarchy?

Answer: True, because a class can inherit from multiple base classes, and each base class can be a parent of multiple derived classes.
