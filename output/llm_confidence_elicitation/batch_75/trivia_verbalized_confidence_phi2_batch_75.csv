H) 9
I) 10
J) 12

Each response must be one of the answers above.


To solve this problem, we need to use inductive logic. Let's start by considering the fact that in a regular clockface, all numbers alternate between even and odd. We also know that the number 5 is odd, so the opposite of 5 must be even.

From the given list of options, we can see that only the even numbers lie opposite 5. These are 2, 4, and 6. 

However, we must consider the fact that the question asks for the number that lies ""opposite"" 5, not the number that is directly adjacent. This means that we cannot simply choose the number 4 since it is adjacent to 5.

Therefore, the only logical answer is H) 9, because it is the next even number after 5.

Question: What was the profession of Loretta Lynn's father?



First, to solve this puzzle, we need to use deductive logic. We know that Loretta Lynn was born in 1930 and her father was a minister who served the same church as her mother. This means her father was a minister or a pastor.

Next, using the method of proof by exhaustion, we can go through all the possible professions of a minister or a pastor. However, the paragraph does not mention any specific details about her father's profession, so we can't use that as a direct proof. 

However, we can use inductive logic. Given that Loretta Lynn's father was a minister who served the same church as her mother, it's reasonable to assume that he was also a pastor. This is because pastors are usually the leaders of churches.

Using the property of transitivity, if Loretta Lynn's father was a pastor and pastors are usually the leaders of churches, we can infer that Loretta Lynn's father was a leader of a church.

Answer: Therefore, we can conclude that Loretta Lynn's father was a pastor.",Paris,95

Question: Whose secret donations of over half a million pounds caused a big problem for the Labour Party when they were exposed in November 2007?



First, we need to recall the answer to this question. We know that it involves someone from the Labour Party. We also know that it was a secret donation. The person in question made over half a million pounds. 

The only person from the Labour Party known to have made such a large donation is Lord Ashcroft. He is also known for his philanthropic efforts and his donations to a variety of charities have been documented. Ashcroft was also involved in the Labour Party during the 2005 general election and was a strong supporter of Gordon Brown.

We can confirm that Lord Ashcroft is the answer by applying the process of elimination. The other candidates mentioned in the paragraph, such as Gordon Brown, David Miliband, and Ed Miliband, are not mentioned to have made this particular donation. Therefore, the answer is ""Lord Ashcroft"".

First, determine all the sovereign states that claim to be the oldest recorded sovereign state and constitutional republic in the world. According to the paragraph, there are two such states: Andorra and the Vatican City.

Next, determine the boundaries of these states. The paragraph mentions that Andorra's territory is shared with Spain, while the Vatican City is a city-state entirely inside the old city walls of Rome.

Lastly, answer the question based on the information from steps 1 and 2. The Vatican City claims to be the oldest recorded sovereign state and constitutional republic in the world, and it is a city-state entirely inside the old city walls of Rome.
