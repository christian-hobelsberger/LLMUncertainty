Question: is systemic functional grammar a contemporary language theory?

Answer:
{""answer"": ""yes"", ""confidence"": 90}

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) is a contemporary language theory. First, I need to recall what the passage says about SFG. The passage mentions that SFG was originated by Michael Halliday and is part of systemic functional linguistics, which is a social semiotic approach. It also explains the terms 'systemic' and 'functional' in relation to language's role in human experience and interpersonal relations.

Now, the key here is determining if SFG is considered contemporary. The term ""contemporary"" usually refers to something current or modern. The passage doesn't mention when SFG was developed beyond stating it's originated by Halliday. However, Halliday is a prominent figure in linguistics, and SFG is a well-established theory. Since the passage doesn't provide a specific date, but the theory is still actively studied and referenced today, it's reasonable to infer that it's contemporary. The confidence score is 90 because while the passage doesn't explicitly state the time frame, the context implies it's a current theory. There's a slight uncertainty due to the lack of explicit time information, but the overall context supports the answer 'yes'.
Okay, I think that's it. The answer should be yes with high confidence.

To determine if season 7 is the final season of True Blood, I need to analyze the passage provided.

Passage: Williams is best known as the founder and last original surviving member of the Motown vocal group The Temptations, a group in which he continues to perform; he also owns the rights to the Temptations name.
Question: are there any of the temptations still living?

The passage states that Williams is the ""last original surviving member"" of The Temptations. This implies that all other original members are no longer living. However, the question asks if there are any of the Temptations still living, which could include current members who may have joined later or replacements. The passage does not provide information about current members who are not original. Therefore, based on the given information, the answer is yes, because Williams is still living, but the passage does not confirm if there are other current members besides him.
The answer is yes, but the confidence is low because the passage only mentions Williams as the last original surviving member and does not provide information about current members who may have joined later or replacements.

{""answer"": ""yes"", ""confidence"": 30}
Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is asking if there are any of the Temptations still living. The passage says that Williams is the ""last original surviving member"" of the group. So that means the other original members aren't alive anymore. But the question isn't specifically about the original members. It just asks if any of the Temptations are still living. 

Wait, but the passage also mentions that Williams continues to perform with the group. So even though he's the last original, there might be current members who are not original. However, the passage doesn't say anything about other current members. It only mentions Williams as the last original and that",yes,30.0

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if shaving your head makes lice go away. The passage provided mentions that shaving the head or cutting hair very short helps control lice infestation. It also says that short hair or a shaven scalp are preventive measures. Moreover, maintaining this for the duration of the parasites' reproductive cycle will eliminate lice. 

So, the key points here are that shaving the head is a method to control lice, and if done properly (like keeping it short for the entire reproductive cycle), it can eliminate the infestation. The answer seems straightforward from the passage. The confidence is high",yes,90.0

Question: does a turtle's shell grow with them?
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if a turtle's shell grows with them. I need to figure out the answer based on the passage provided.

First, I'll read through the passage again to make sure I understand the key points. The passage talks about the carapacial ridge's role in turtle shell development. It mentions that embryological analyses show the carapacial ridge initiates the formation of the shell. The process involves axial arrest, which leads to the ribs being dorsalized, the shoulder girdle rearranged and encapsulated, and the carapace developing. There's also a mention of O. semitestacea, which has axial arrest but lacks fan-shaped ribs and a carapace, suggesting the carapacial ridge's function evolved over time.

Now, the question is whether the shell grows with the turtle. The passage explains that the shell develops during embryonic stages due to the carapacial ridge. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether the shell continues to grow as the turtle matures. But I know from general knowledge that turtle shells are part of their skeleton and grow as they grow. However, the passage focuses on the embryonic development. Wait, the passage says that the carapace develops during the formation process, but does it mention postnatal growth? The passage doesn't talk about growth after birth. So, based solely on the passage, the information is about the initial formation, not whether it continues to grow. But",,

Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is asking if Dr. House dies in the last episode of House MD.

House admits to faking his death to avoid jail and losing his medical license. Then House says, ""I'm dead, Wilson,"" which is a bit confusing. But later, House asks Wilson how he would like to spend his last months before he dies from terminal cancer. Wait, so House has terminal cancer, but he faked his death.

Yes, Zidane won La Liga as a coach. The passage states that in his first two seasons as manager, he won the La Liga title. So the answer is yes.

Alright, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Zidane won La Liga as a coach. I need to check the passage provided.

So it clearly states he won La Liga during his first two seasons as a coach. 

The answer should be 'yes' because the passage explicitly mentions the La Liga title. The confidence is high since the information is directly stated. I'd say 95% confident because there's no ambiguity here. No need to guess; the answer is confirmed in the text.

Okay, let's see. The question is asking if you can use a TracFone with Straight Talk service. I need to check the passage provided.

Looking at the passage, it says that Straight Talk allows customers to bring their own phones from AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, or unlocked GSM phones. But then it mentions that this program doesn't work with branded Straight Talk, SafeLink, TracFone, Total Wireless, and NET10 phones. 

So the key part here is the list of phones that aren't compatible. TracFone is explicitly mentioned as one of the brands that can't be used with the program. Therefore, the answer should be no. The confidence is high because the passage directly states this, so I'd say 95% confident.

Her character is shy, growing assertive but amiable, and artistically inclined, and shares romantic interest with Jim Halpert, whom she begins dating in the fourth season and marries and starts a family with as the series continues.
Question: does pam and jim get together in the office?
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Pam and Jim get together in the Office. 

First, I need to recall the passage provided. It mentions that Pam shares a romantic interest with Jim Halpert, whom she begins dating in the fourth season and marries as the series continues. The passage also states they start a family. 

So, the key points here are that they start dating in season 4 and get married by the end of the series. The question is whether they get together, which would mean they start a relationship. Since the passage explicitly says they begin dating in season 4, the answer should be yes. 

I should check if there's any ambiguity. The passage doesn't mention any obstacles or breakups, just that they marry and have a family. So the answer is definitely yes. The confidence score would be high because the information is directly stated. Maybe 95? That's pretty certain.
Okay, so the answer is yes, and the confidence is 95. Let me make sure there's no trick here. The question is straightforward, and the passage clearly states their relationship progresses to marriage. No conflicting info. Yep, that's solid.

Question: does a goal from a throw in count as a goal?
The answer is yes, but the passage says that a goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in. So the answer is no. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again. The passage states that if a player throws the ball directly into their own goal, it's a corner kick. If it's an offensive goal, it's a goal kick. So, does that mean that a goal from a throw-in is not counted as a goal? Or does it mean that the goal is counted, but the result is a corner kick or goal kick? The passage says that the result is a corner kick or goal kick, but does not say that the goal is not counted. However, the wording is a bit ambiguous. But since the passage says ""the result is a corner kick"" and ""the result in this case is a goal kick,"" it seems that the goal is not counted, and instead, the result is a corner or goal kick. So the answer is no.
Okay, I think I need to check the actual rules to confirm. In soccer, if a player throws the ball directly into their own goal, it's a corner kick, and if it's an offensive goal, it's a goal kick. The goal itself is not counted as a goal. So the answer is no.

Question: did the uk have a referendum to join the eu? 

Confidence: 90
Answer: no

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the UK had a referendum to join the EU. First, I need to look at the passage provided. The passage talks about the United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum held on 5 June 1975. The key points here are that the referendum was about continuing membership in the European Communities (EC), which the UK joined in 1973. The question is whether this referendum was about joining the EU.

Wait, the EU as we know it today wasn't formed yet. The European Communities (EC) was a different entity. The UK joined the EC in 1973, and the referendum in 1975 was about staying in the EC. The EU was established later, in 1993, when the Maastricht Treaty came into effect. So the referendum was about the EC, not the EU. Therefore, the answer would be no because the referendum wasn't about joining the EU but about remaining in the EC. The confidence is high because the passage clearly states the referendum's purpose was to gauge support for continued membership in the EC, which is distinct from the EU. So the answer is no with high confidence.

Question: can a local maximum also be an absolute maximum?

Answer:

{""answer"": ""yes"", ""confidence"": 85}
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if a local maximum can also be an absolute maximum. 

First, I need to recall the definitions of local and absolute maxima. From the passage, it says that local extrema are the largest or smallest values within a given range, while absolute extrema are the largest or smallest values over the entire domain of the function.

So, a local maximum is the highest point in some specific interval, but not necessarily the highest overall. However, if the function's highest point in the entire domain occurs within that specific interval, then that local maximum would also be the absolute maximum. For example, consider a function that has its highest value at a single point, say x=2, and that x=2 is within the domain. If we look at a neighborhood around x=2, it's a local maximum. But since it's the highest point overall, it's also the absolute maximum. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes. The confidence is high because the definitions clearly allow for this scenario. I can't think of any exceptions here. So I'll go with 'yes' and a confidence score of 85.

Question: is lethal weapon based on a true story?
Answer: no
Confidence: 100

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if ""Lethal Weapon"" is based on a true story. First, I need to recall what I know about the movie. ""Lethal Weapon"" is a 1987 action comedy film directed by Richard Donner, starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. The passage provided mentions that Shane Black wrote the screenplay in mid-1985. 

Now, the passage says that Black wanted to create an ""urban western"" inspired by Dirty Harry, focusing on a violent character who's reviled but recruited to solve a problem. The protagonists are described as everymen policemen in Los Angeles. However, there's no mention of the story being based on real events or true stories. 

I know from general knowledge that ""Lethal Weapon"" is a fictional story. The characters, while possibly inspired by real-life elements (like the setting in Los Angeles), are not based on actual people or events. The movie's plot involves a partnership between a gruff, ex-convict detective and a rookie cop, which is a fictional premise. 

The answer given in the example is ""no"" with 100% confidence, which aligns with my understanding. There's no indication in the passage that the story is true, and the details provided are about the creative process rather than real events. Therefore, the answer should be ""no",,

Question: is bermuda an island in the caribbean sea?
Based on the passage, Bermuda is located in the North Atlantic Ocean, not the Caribbean Sea. Therefore, the answer is no.

{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 90}
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Bermuda is an island in the Caribbean Sea. The passage provided states that Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean. It gives specific distances from other locations like Cape Hatteras and Puerto Rico, all of which are in the North Atlantic. Additionally, it mentions that Bermuda is an associate member of CARICOM, which is a regional organization including Caribbean nations. However, the key detail here is the location in the North Atlantic Ocean, not the Caribbean Sea. The Caribbean Sea is a different body of water, located to the southeast of Florida and surrounding the Caribbean islands. Since the passage explicitly places Bermuda in the North Atlantic, the answer should be no. The confidence is high because the passage directly states the location, so I'd say 90% confident.
Okay, let's see. The question is whether Bermuda is an island in the Caribbean Sea. The passage says Bermuda is in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Caribbean Sea is a different region. The passage also mentions it's near Puerto Rico, which is in the Caribbean, but the key point is the North Atlantic location. So the answer is no.

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the movie ""The Rock"" is based on a true story. I need to check the provided passage to find any clues.

First, I'll scan through the passage. It mentions the director, producers, writers, cast, and some details about its release and reception. The passage talks about the film's budget, box office success, and even a mention of Don Simpson's dedication. However, there's no information about the story's origin.

Passage: The principal bridesmaid, if one is so designated, may be called the chief bridesmaid or maid of honor if she is unmarried, or the matron of honor if she is married.

Passage: The principal bridesmaid, if one is so designated, may be called the chief bridesmaid or maid of honor if she is unmarried, or the matron of honor if she is married. A junior bridesmaid is a girl who is clearly too young to be married, but who is included as an honorary bridesmaid. In the United States, typically only the maid/matron of honor and the best man are the official witnesses for the wedding license.
Question: do your maid of honor have to be married?
No, the maid of honor does not have to be married. The passage states that the principal bridesmaid, if unmarried, may be called the maid of honor, and if married, the matron of honor. Therefore, the maid of honor can be either unmarried or married, depending on the individual's marital status.
The answer is no, with high confidence.

{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 95}
Okay, let me tackle this. The question is asking if the maid of honor has to be married. The passage says that the principal bridesmaid may be called the maid of honor if she's unmarried, or matron of honor if married. So the maid of honor title is given to an unmarried woman, while a married woman would be called matron of honor. Therefore, the maid of honor doesn't have to be married; in fact, the term ""maid"" implies she's unmarried. The answer should be no. The confidence is high because the passage directly addresses this, so I'd say 95% confident.
Okay, so the answer is no, and confidence is 95. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The passage clearly differentiates between maid of honor (unmarried) and matron of honor (married). So the maid of honor is specifically for an unmarried person. Therefore, the answer is definitely no. Confidence is high, maybe 95. Yep, that's right.

Question: are a cougar and mountain lion the same animal?
Answer:

{""answer"": ""yes"", ""confidence"": 95}
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if a cougar and a mountain lion are the same animal. I need to check the passage provided.

Looking at the first sentence of the passage: ""The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the puma, mountain lion, panther, or catamount..."" So right there, it lists ""mountain lion"" as one of the common names for cougar. That directly answers the question with a yes. 

The confidence score is high because the passage explicitly states that mountain lion is an alias. There's no conflicting information here. The rest of the passage talks about the animal's range, habits, and relations, but the initial mention is clear. So I can be confident the answer is yes with a high score, maybe 95 or 100. Since the user wants exactly two fields, I'll go with 95 as the confidence.

Question: can a puppy see when they first open their eyes? The passage states that puppies open their eyes about nine to eleven days following birth. At first, their retinas are poorly developed and their vision is poor. So, the answer is no, they cannot see well when they first open their eyes. The confidence is high because the passage directly addresses the question.
{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 95}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if a puppy can see when they first open their eyes. The passage says that puppies open their eyes around nine to eleven days after birth. But then it mentions that at first, their retinas are poorly developed and their vision is poor. So even though their eyes are open, their vision isn't good yet. The key here is understanding that opening their eyes doesn't mean they have full vision immediately. The passage explicitly states their vision is poor at that stage, so the answer should be no. I'm pretty confident because the passage directly addresses the development of their vision right after their eyes open. Maybe a confidence score of 95 makes sense here since the information is clear and directly answered.
Okay, so the answer is no, and the confidence is 95. The passage clearly states that when they open their eyes, their vision is poor. So the answer is definitely no. I think that's right.
Okay, I'll go with the answer no and confidence 95.

Only other Pokémon that the player has caught can evolve, including the ones of the same species of the partner Pokémon. Some features, like Pokémon breeding and HMs, will be absent from the games.
Question: can pikachu evolve in let's go pikachu?

The answer is no, because the passage states that the player's starting Pikachu cannot evolve, like Pokémon Yellow. However, other Pokémon that the player has caught can evolve, including those of the same species as the partner Pokémon. Therefore, while the starting Pikachu cannot evolve, other Pokémon in the game can.
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if Pikachu can evolve in Let's Go Pikachu. The passage says that the evolution mechanic is back, but the starting Pikachu can't evolve like in Pokémon Yellow. It mentions that only other Pokémon caught can evolve, including those of the same species as the partner Pokémon. So the starting Pikachu can't evolve, but other Pokémon can. So the answer would be no, because the starting Pikachu can't. But wait, the question is general—does Pikachu (in general) evolve or just the starting one? The passage specifies that the starting one can't, but other caught ones can. So if the player catches other Pikachu, they can evolve. But the question is about the starting Pikachu. The answer is no for the starting one, but yes for others. But the question is phrased as ""can Pikachu evolve in Let's Go Pikachu?"" which might be ambiguous. However, the passage explicitly says the starting Pikachu can't, so the answer is no. The confidence is high because the passage directly states that.

Question: the bill of sale is absolute proof of ownership of the goods?

Based on the passage, the answer is 'no' because the passage states that absolute bills of sale are ""simply documents evidencing assignments, transfers and other assurances of personal chattels, which are substantially no more than mere contracts of sale of goods."" This suggests that they do not provide absolute proof of ownership, but rather evidence of a contract of sale. Therefore, the answer is 'no' with a high confidence score. 

{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 90}
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if an absolute bill of sale is absolute proof of ownership based on the given passage. 

First, I need to read the passage carefully. It says that absolute bills of sale don't represent any form of security. They are just documents that evidence assignments, transfers, and other assurances of personal chattels. The passage also mentions they are ""substantially no more than mere contracts of sale of goods"" under common law contract and sale of goods laws.

So, the key points here are that the bill of sale isn't a security instrument and is more of a contract for sale. The term ""absolute"" here might be misleading. The passage clarifies that even though it's called an absolute bill, it doesn't serve as absolute proof of ownership. Instead, it's a contract that evidences the transfer, but not necessarily proof of ownership. 

The question is asking if it's absolute proof. The passage",no,90.0

The passage states that the fictional name ""Cabot Cove"" for the series' coastal town was derived from an actual bay harbor inlet in Kennebunkport, Maine. This implies that while the name ""Cabot Cove"" is fictional for the series, it is based on a real place in Maine, specifically a bay harbor inlet in Kennebunkport. Therefore, there is a place in Maine with a name similar to Cabot Cove, but the passage does not explicitly confirm that there is a place called ""Cabot Cove, Maine."" It only mentions that the name was derived from an actual location in Kennebunkport, which is in Maine. So the answer is 'no' because the passage does not directly state that there is a place called Cabot Cove, Maine.

Question: is there a bridge from spain to africa? 

Based on the passage, the answer is 'yes' or 'no'? The passage mentions a hypothetical bridge or tunnel that would connect Europe and Africa, specifically mentioning Spain and Morocco. The question is about a bridge from Spain to Africa, which is part of the hypothetical project described. Therefore, the answer is 'no' because the bridge is not currently built, but the passage does not explicitly state that it is not built.

The answer is 'no' because the passage states that the second season aired from September 26, 2017, to March 13, 2018, and served as the lead-out program for Super Bowl LII in February 2018. The mention of the Super Bowl episode suggests that the season was not yet over at that time, and the season concluded in March 2018. Therefore, the answer is 'no' to the question of whether This Is Us is over for the season 2.

Question: are all the game of thrones books written?
The answer is: no
Confidence: 85

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if all the Game of Thrones books are written. First, I need to refer back to the passage provided.

The passage mentions that George R.R. Martin started writing the first book, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, and it was published in 1996. The passage also states that he initially thought the series would be a trilogy but has published five out of seven planned volumes. The fifth book, A Dance with Dragons, was published in 2011 after six years of writing. Then it says he's still working on the sixth novel, The Winds of Winter. 

So, the key points here are that there are seven planned books, but only five have been published. The sixth is in progress, and the seventh hasn't been mentioned. Therefore, not all books are written yet. The answer should be 'no'. 

The confidence score is 85 because the passage clearly states the number of published books versus the planned total, and mentions that the sixth is still being written. There's no ambiguity here. The user might have confused the series with the TV show, but the question specifically refers to the books. So the answer is definitely 'no' with high confidence.

Question: does the sister die in the lovely bones?

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the sister dies in ""The Lovely Bones."" First, I need to recall the plot of the book. The main character is Susie Salmon, who is murdered. The story is told from her perspective as she's in heaven. The sister mentioned here is likely Susie's sister, maybe her younger sister, given the context.

In the passage provided, there's a mention of Susie moving to a larger part of heaven and watching events on Earth. Then there's a part about Lindsey and Samuel having a daughter named Abigail Suzanne. Wait, Lindsey and Samuel are characters in the book—Lindsey is Susie's mother, and Samuel is her father. They have a daughter, Abigail Suzanne, which would be Susie's sister. 

The next part talks about Harvey, who is stalking a young woman in New Hampshire and gets hit by an icicle, leading to his death. Then, at the end, a couple finds Susie's charm bracelet but doesn't realize its significance. Susie ends the story by wishing the reader a long and happy life.

The question is whether the sister dies. The sister in question is Abigail Suzanne, Susie's younger sister. In the book, Abigail Suzanne is born after Susie's death. The story follows Susie's perspective as she watches her family and the world from heaven. The sister, Abigail, is alive in the story. The",,

Question: is there a sequel to dazed and confused? 

Answer: yes
Confidence: 90
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a sequel to Dazed and Confused. First, I need to recall the information from the passage provided.

The passage mentions that Linklater's 1993 film Dazed and Confused is considered a spiritual sequel by him. Then it talks about a new project titled ""That's What I'm Talking About,"" which is set in a university in the 1980s and is described as a spiritual sequel to both Dazed and Confused and Boyhood. The key here is the term ""spiritual sequel."" 

Wait, the question is about a sequel to Dazed and Confused. The passage states that the new film is a spiritual sequel to Dazed and Confused. But does that mean it's an actual sequel, or just a spiritual one? The term ""spiritual sequel"" suggests that it's inspired by or thematically connected, but not necessarily a direct continuation in the story. However, the user's question is whether there's a sequel, and the passage explicitly says that the new project is considered a spiritual sequel. So the answer would be yes, there is a spiritual sequel. But the user might be using ""sequel"" in the general sense, not strictly a direct follow-up. 

The answer given in the example was ""yes"" with confidence 90. The passage clearly states that the",,

Passage: The Isle of Man is in a one-sided de facto currency union with the United Kingdom: the Manx government has decided to make UK currency legal tender on the island, and to back its own notes and coins with Bank of England notes.
Question: is isle of man money legal tender in uk?

The answer is ""no"" because the passage states that the Manx government has decided to make UK currency legal tender on the island, which means that UK currency is legal tender in the Isle of Man, not the other way around. The question is asking if Isle of Man money is legal tender in the UK, which is not stated in the passage. Therefore, the answer is ""no"".
{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 90}

Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is asking whether the Isle of Man's money is legal tender in the UK. The passage says that the Isle of Man is in a de facto currency union with the UK. Specifically, it mentions that the Manx government makes UK currency legal tender on the island and backs their own notes and coins with Bank of England notes.

So, the key point here is that the UK currency (which is the pound) is legal tender in the Isle of Man. But the question is the reverse: is the Isle of Man's money legal tender in the UK? The passage doesn't mention anything about the UK recognizing Manx currency as legal tender. Instead, it's the other way around. The Manx government is using UK currency as legal tender on their island, but there's no indication that the UK accepts Manx currency as legal tender. 

Therefore, the answer should be ""no"" because the passage doesn't state that Manx money is legal tender in the UK.",no,90.0

Answer:

{""answer"": ""yes"", ""confidence"": 95}
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret are owned by the same company. 

First, I need to look at the passage provided. The passage mentions that L Brands has flagship brands including both Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. The key sentence here is ""Its flagship brands include Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works."" The use of ""its"" refers to L Brands, so that means both brands are under the same parent company, L Brands.

The passage also provides additional info about L Brands' revenue and ranking, but that's not directly relevant to the ownership question. The main point is the mention of both brands as part of L Brands' portfolio. There's no indication in the passage that they are separate entities. 

I should check if there's any possibility of confusion. For example, sometimes companies might have different subsidiaries, but the wording here is clear. The passage lists both as flagship brands of L Brands, which implies they are owned by the same company. 

So the answer should be 'yes' with high confidence. The confidence score is 95 because the passage directly states they are both under L Brands, leaving little room for doubt. There's no conflicting information here. 

I need to make sure the JSON format is correct, with ""answer"" as ""yes"" and ""confidence"" as 95.",yes,95.0

The 87-square-kilometre (34 sq mi) island is divided roughly 60/40 between the French Republic (53 km, 20 sq mi) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (34 km, 13 sq mi); but the two parts are roughly equal in population, with slightly more people living on the Dutch side. It is the world's smallest inhabited island divided between two nations. The division dates to 1648. The southern Dutch part comprises Sint Maarten and is one of four constituent countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The northern French part comprises the Collectivité de Saint-Martin (Collectivity of St Martin) and is an overseas collectivity of France.
Question: is st martin and st maarten the same island?

Yes, the answer is 'yes'. The passage states that Saint Martin (French: Saint-Martin; Dutch: Sint Maarten) is an island divided between two nations, with the southern Dutch part being Sint Maarten and the northern French part being Saint-Martin. The names are used interchangeably to refer to the same island, with the distinction being the administrative division between the Netherlands and France. The passage also mentions that it is the world's smallest inhabited island divided between two nations, reinforcing that both names refer to the same island.

The confidence score is high because the passage clearly explains the relationship between the two names and their administrative divisions.
{""answer"": ""yes"", ""confidence"": 95} The answer is 'yes' because the passage explicitly states that Saint Martin (French: Saint-Martin; Dutch: Sint Maarten) is the same island divided between the French Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The names are used interchangeably, with the distinction being the administrative division between the two nations. The passage also confirms that it is the world's smallest inhabited island divided between two nations, further supporting that both names refer to the same island.

The confidence score is 95 because the passage clearly explains the relationship between the two names and their administrative divisions, leaving little room for ambiguity. The explicit mention of the island's division and the use of both names interchangeably provide strong evidence for the answer.

Question: can you go to jail for burning american flag?

Based on the passage, the answer is yes. The passage states that if the flag belongs to someone else, the offender could be charged with petty larceny or destruction of private property, which can result in jail time. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that it's unconstitutional to prohibit flag desecration as symbolic speech. The answer is yes, but the confidence is not very high because the passage is a bit ambiguous about whether the charges would actually result in jail time.
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if you can go to jail for burning the American flag. The passage mentions that the Supreme Court allows flag burning as symbolic speech, but if the flag is someone else's property, you could face charges like petty larceny or destruction of private property. Now, petty larceny is a criminal offense, and depending on the jurisdiction, that could lead to jail time. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state that jail time is a consequence, just that charges might be brought. The answer is yes because there's a possibility of legal charges, but the confidence isn't high because the passage doesn't clearly link those charges to jail time. So I'll go with 'yes' and a moderate confidence score, maybe 70.

Question: are holland america and carnival owned by the same company? 

Okay, let's see. The passage says that Holland America Line is a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation & plc. So if it's a subsidiary, that means it's owned by Carnival Corporation & plc. The question is asking if Holland America and Carnival are owned by the same company. Wait, but Carnival Corporation & plc is the parent company. So Holland America is part of Carnival Corporation. So the answer would be yes, they are owned by the same company. The confidence score would be high because the passage directly states the relationship. I think that's straightforward.

Question: is vitamin k produced in the large intestine?
Yes
{""answer"": ""yes"", ""confidence"": 90}
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if vitamin K is produced in the large intestine. I need to check the passage provided.

Looking at the passage, there's a sentence that says: ""The colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the colonic bacteria, such as vitamin K..."" So the colon, which is part of the large intestine, absorbs vitamin K produced by bacteria. The passage also mentions that vitamin K is important for blood coagulation and that daily intake might not be sufficient. 

The key point here is that the colon (part of the large intestine) absorbs vitamins created by bacteria, and vitamin K is listed as one of them. Therefore, the answer should be yes. The confidence is high because the passage directly states this. I'd say 90% confidence since the information is explicitly mentioned. No conflicting info here. So the answer is yes with 90 confidence.
Okay, I think that's it. The answer is yes, and the confidence is 90.

Question: is mahi-mahi a type of dolphin?

Based on the passage, the answer is 'no'. The passage states that the mahi-mahi is also called dolphin, but clarifies that it is a type of fish, not a dolphin. The passage specifically mentions that it is a ray-finned fish and part of the Coryphaenidae family. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.

Okay, let me tackle this question. The user is asking if mahi-mahi is a type of dolphin. The passage says it's also called dolphin, but then clarifies it's a ray-finned fish.

So even though the name is similar, the passage makes it clear it's a different category.

If the passage is about ""The Next Step,"" then the answer is yes. But if the passage is about a different series, then no.

To determine if the TV show Blue Bloods is still on air, we need to consider the information provided in the passage. The passage states that the show was renewed for a ninth season, which is set to premiere on September 28, 2018. However, the current date is not provided in the passage. If the current date is after September 28, 2018, then the show would have aired the ninth season and may have continued or ended. If the current date is before that date, the show is still in production and scheduled to air. Without the current date, we cannot definitively determine if the show is still on air. Therefore, the answer is no, as the passage does not provide enough information to confirm that the show is still on air.

Question: is no man's sky exclusive to ps4?
Okay, let me check the passage. The question is asking if No Man's Sky is exclusive to PS4. The passage says it was released for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in August 2016, and then for Xbox One in July 2018. So it's available on PS4, Windows, and Xbox One. Since it's on multiple platforms, the answer is no, it's not exclusive to PS4. The confidence score",,

Question: can a terminating decimal be written as a recurring decimal?
Yes, a terminating decimal can be written as a recurring decimal. For example, 1.000... is equal to 0.999..., which is a recurring decimal. Similarly, 1.585000... is equal to 1.584999..., which is also a recurring decimal. This is because the terminating decimal can be expressed as a fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10, and this fraction can also be expressed as a repeating decimal with a repetend of 9s.

The passage states that every terminating decimal can be written as a repeating decimal with a repetend of 9. This is demonstrated with examples such as 1.000... = 0.999... and 1.585000... = 1.584999.... Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.

Question: is mail delivered on saturday before memorial day?
The passage does not mention anything about mail delivery on Saturdays before Memorial Day. Therefore, the answer is no. However, the confidence score is low because the passage does not provide direct information about mail delivery on Saturdays before Memorial Day. The answer is no with low confidence.
{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 30}

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if mail is delivered on Saturday before Memorial Day. The passage provided talks about how holidays are categorized in the DMM, specifically listing ""Widely Observed"" and ""Not Widely Observed"" holidays. The ""Widely Observed"" ones include Memorial Day, but the passage doesn't mention anything about mail delivery schedules or weekends.

So, the key point here is that the passage doesn't provide information about mail delivery on Saturdays relative to Memorial Day. The answer given was ""no"" with low confidence because there's no direct info. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any implicit information. For example, if Memorial Day is a federal holiday, maybe there are standard mail delivery rules. But the passage doesn't say that. The DMM is the source here, and since it's about holiday categorization, not delivery schedules, the answer is indeed not directly addressed. Therefore, the answer is no, but confidence is low. The initial response seems correct.

The answer is no. Pinot noir and pinot gris are different grape varieties, although they are related. Pinot gris is thought to be a mutant clone of pinot noir. The passage states that pinot gris is a white wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera, while pinot noir is a red wine grape variety. The passage also mentions that pinot gris has a grayish-blue fruit, which accounts for its name, while pinot noir is known for its dark color and is used to produce red wines.

Passage: Other white beans include cannellini, 'Great Northern', the lima beans known as ``butter beans'', and the runner bean.
Question: is a navy bean the same as great northern?

The passage lists ""Great Northern"" as a type of white bean. It does not mention navy beans. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine if a navy bean is the same as Great Northern. The answer would be 'no' if we assume that different names imply different beans, but the passage does not provide enough information to confirm this. However, in general knowledge, navy beans and Great Northern beans are different varieties. But since the question is based solely on the passage, we must rely only on the given information.

Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.
Question: did the great depression affect the whole world? The answer is yes.
Okay, so I need to figure out if the Great Depression affected the whole world based on the given passage. Let me read through the passage again to make sure I understand the details.

The passage starts by explaining that the Great Depression began in the United States after the stock market crash in 1929 and became a worldwide event. It mentions that between 1929 and 1932, the worldwide GDP fell by 15%, which is a significant drop. Then it compares this to the Great Recession, where the GDP fell by less than 1%. The passage also states that some economies started recovering by the mid-1930s, but in many countries, the effects lasted until the beginning of World War II.

The question is asking if the Great Depression affected the whole world. The passage clearly states that the depression started in the US but became worldwide news with the Black Tuesday crash. The mention of worldwide GDP decline and the effects lasting in many countries until WWII supports the idea that it was a global event. The answer given is 'yes', and I need to confirm if that's correct based on the passage. The key points here are the worldwide GDP decline and the mention of effects in many countries. So, the answer should be yes with high confidence.

Although Bertier is unable to play due to being paralyzed from the waist down, the team goes on to win the state championship. Bertier would remain a paraplegic for the rest of his life.
Question: do the titans win in remember the titans? The passage is about Bertier, not the Titans. The question is about the Titans, which is a different topic. The passage does not provide any information about the Titans or their victories. Therefore, the answer is no.
{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 100}
Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a passage about Bertier getting injured in a car accident and the team winning the state championship despite his injury. The question is asking if the Titans win in ""Remember the Titans."" 

First, I need to check if the passage mentions the Titans. The passage only talks about Bertier, his injury, and his team winning the state championship. There's no mention of the Titans or the movie ""Remember the Titans."" The team in the passage is referred to as ""the team,"" but not specifically the Titans.

The user's answer is ""no"" because the passage is about Bertier, not the Titans. The question is about a different topic. Since the passage doesn't provide any info on the Titans' victory, the answer is no. The confidence is 100 because there's no overlap between the passage and the question's subject. So the JSON should reflect that.

Question: is there a sequel to mrs frisby and the rats of nimh? Passage: The story is set in the year 2079 in the United States, and it is the sequel to the 1993 film, The Iron Giant. The film was written and directed by Brad Bird, who also directed the 1996 film The Iron Giant. The film was released on October 15, 1999.
Question: is there a sequel to the iron giant?

Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First, the user is asking if there's a sequel to ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH."" The passage mentions ""Racso and the Rats of NIMH"" as the 1986 sequel. So the answer here is yes. The confidence is high because the passage directly states it's a sequel.

Next, the second question is about ""The Iron Giant."" The passage says it's a sequel to the 1993 film, but then mentions the film was released in 1999. Wait, that seems conflicting. The 1993 film is the original, and the passage is talking about a sequel to that. But the passage says the story is set in 2079, which might be a different context. However, the passage also says the film was written and directed by Brad Bird, who also directed the 1996 film. Wait, that's confusing. The",,

Question: does bourbon have to be made in kentucky?

Answer: no
Confidence: 95
Okay, let me tackle this question. The user is asking if bourbon has to be made in Kentucky. From the passage provided, I remember reading that bourbon can be made anywhere in the United States, but it's strongly associated with the South and Kentucky specifically. The passage clearly states, ""While bourbon may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South, and with Kentucky in particular."" So the key point here is that the law allows bourbon to be produced in any state, but Kentucky is where it's most famous. The answer should be 'no' because the passage explicitly mentions that it's not restricted to Kentucky. The confidence is high because the passage directly addresses this, so I'd say 95% confident.
Okay, so the answer is no, and confidence is 95. Let me make sure there's no conflicting info. The passage says ""may be made anywhere"" which directly answers the question. Yep, that's clear. No other parts of the passage contradict this. So the JSON should have answer ""no"" and confidence 95.

Question: did borderlands 2 come out before the pre sequel?
To determine the answer, I need to check the release dates of Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. According to the passage, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is set between 2009's Borderlands and 2012's Borderlands 2. The passage also mentions that the Pre-Sequel was released on 14 October 2014, while Borderlands 2 was released in 2012. Since Borderlands 2 was released in 2012 and the Pre-Sequel in 2014, Borderlands 2 came out before the Pre-Sequel. Therefore, the answer is no.

The passage states that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is set between 2009's Borderlands and 2012's Borderlands 2. This implies that Borderlands 2 was released in 2012, while the Pre-Sequel was released on 14 October 2014. Since 2012 is earlier than 2014, Borderlands 2 was indeed released before the Pre-Sequel.

Question: is it illegal to catch a wild horse or burro and sell it for profit?
The answer is no.
Confidence: 75
The passage does not explicitly mention whether it is illegal to catch and sell wild horses or burros for profit. It describes protections against harassment or killing, but does not address the legality of catching and selling. Therefore, the answer is no based on the information given.
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if it's illegal to catch a wild horse or burro and sell it for profit. The passage provided talks about protections against harassment or killing these animals on federal land. It mentions that the BLM is tasked with managing their populations and maintaining ecological balance, but I need to check if catching and selling is addressed.

The passage says it's a crime to harass or kill them, but catching and selling isn't explicitly mentioned. The act requires protection as symbols of the West and management plans to prevent overpopulation. However, the question is about catching and selling for profit. Since the passage doesn't mention anything about selling, the answer would be no because there's no explicit statement that makes this illegal. The confidence is 75 because while the passage doesn't say it's illegal, it's possible that other laws might cover this, but based solely on the given text, there's no information to confirm it's illegal. So the answer is no with 75 confidence.

Question: does cutting the top of a tree kill it? Based on the passage, the answer is:

{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 80}

The passage states that topping trees causes ""significant stress and future safety issues,"" but it doesn't explicitly say that topping kills the tree. The answer is ""no"" because the passage does not provide direct evidence that topping kills the tree, only that it causes stress and safety issues. The confidence is 80 because the passage implies that topping is harmful but not necessarily fatal.
Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether cutting the top of a tree kills it, based on the given passage. 

First, I need to look at the passage again. It says that hundreds of large trees are topped each year, causing significant stress and future safety issues. Also, there's a survey showing that people's knowledge about tree care is limited. 

The key point here is that the passage mentions topping causes stress and safety issues, but does it say the tree dies? The answer given was ""no"" with 80 confidence. The reasoning is that the passage doesn't explicitly state that topping kills the tree, only that it's harmful. 

So, I need to check if there's any implication that topping leads to death. The passage says ""significant stress and future safety issues,"" which could mean the tree is damaged or dangerous, but not necessarily dead. Maybe the tree can survive but is weakened.

Question: does the world cup champion have to qualify for the next world cup?

Based on the passage, the answer is yes because the passage states that the defending champions no longer receive an automatic berth starting from the 2006 World Cup. Therefore, they must qualify like other teams. The confidence is high as the passage explicitly mentions this change in policy.

So, after 2006, the defending champions don't get an automatic berth. That means they have to qualify like everyone else. The passage is pretty clear about that change. So the answer should be yes. I'm pretty confident because the passage explicitly states the change in 2006. Maybe 90 confidence because it's a direct statement, but maybe there's a tiny chance of misunderstanding, but probably not. So the answer is yes with high confidence.

Question: is destiny 2 a continuation of destiny 1?
Yes, the passage states that Destiny 2 is the sequel to 2014's Destiny, which implies it is a continuation of the first game. The narrative also connects the two games, as the events of Destiny 2 follow the story of the first game.
{""answer"": ""yes"", ""confidence"": 95}
Alright, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if Destiny 2 is a continuation of Destiny 1. 

First, I need to check the passage provided. The passage clearly states that Destiny 2 is the sequel to 2014's Destiny.

Additionally, the narrative connects the two, mentioning that the events of Destiny 2 follow the story of the first game. 

The user's answer should be ""yes"" based on this information. The confidence score is high because the passage explicitly uses the word ""sequel,"" which leaves little ambiguity. There's no conflicting information here. So, I'll set the confidence at 95, which is very high but not 100, just to account for any possible minor ambiguities, though in this case, the answer is pretty straightforward.

Okay, let me tackle this question. The user is asking if pork roll is the same as Taylor Ham. The passage says that pork roll is regionally known as Taylor Ham. That seems like a direct equivalence. Then it mentions that Taylor Ham was developed by John Taylor and that other producers started using pork roll because of labeling rules. So, even though there are different names, they're referring to the same product. The answer should be yes.

Passage: On October 9, 2015, Los Lobos was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time.
Question: is los lobos in the rock and roll hall of fame?
The answer is 'no' because the passage only mentions that they were nominated for the first time. The passage does not state that they were inducted. Therefore, the answer is 'no' with high confidence.

{""answer"": ""no"", ""confidence"": 90}
Okay, let me tackle this. The user wants to know if Los Lobos is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame based on the given passage. The passage says they were nominated for the first time on October 9, 2015. The question is whether they are inducted. 

First, I need to understand the difference between being nominated and being inducted. Being nominated means they were considered, but induction is the actual acceptance. The passage only mentions the nomination, not the outcome. So the answer should be 'no' because there's no information that they were inducted. 

The confidence is high because the passage clearly states the nomination but doesn't mention induction. So the answer is 'no' with a confidence score of 90. That makes sense. I should make sure there's no other info in the passage that I missed. Nope, just the nomination date. So the JSON should have ""no"" and 90.
Okay, I think that's it. Let me just double-check. The key point is that the passage only mentions the nomination, not the induction. So the answer is definitely 'no' with high confidence.

So first, I need to check if the current date is after August 4, 2018. Since today's date is, let's say, 2023, which is way after 2018, the show would have ended. But wait, maybe the question is being asked in 2023, so the answer would be no. However, the passage doesn't mention anything about reruns or streaming. But the question specifically asks if it's ""still on tv,"" which usually means currently airing. Since the original run ended in 2018, the answer is no. The confidence is high because the dates are clear. But I need to make sure there's no mention of it being revived. The passage doesn't say anything about that, so I can safely say no with high confidence.
The answer is no because the show concluded its",,
