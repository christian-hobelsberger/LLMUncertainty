Confidence: 80

{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 80} 

Explanation:
The turtle shell is a dynamic structure that changes shape as the turtle grows. The carapacial ridge plays a crucial role in this process, but the shell also grows and changes shape as the turtle grows. The carapacial ridge initiates the formation of the turtle shell, but it is not a fixed structure that grows with the turtle. Instead, the turtle shell grows and changes shape as the turtle grows, and the carapacial ridge continues to evolve and modify the shell to accommodate the turtle's growth. Therefore, the shell does not grow with the turtle as they grow.",False,80.0

Pierre de Fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique, adequality, for finding the maxima and minima of functions.
Question: can a local maximum also be an absolute maximum","?

**Passage Analysis:**
The passage discusses the concept of extrema in mathematical analysis, specifically the maxima and minima of a function. It also mentions Pierre de Fermat, who proposed a general technique for finding these extrema. However, it does not explicitly address whether a local maximum can also be an absolute maximum.

**Answer:**
False

**Confidence Score:** 90

Reasoning:
The passage does not provide any information about whether a local maximum can also be an absolute maximum. The concept of absolute extrema is not discussed, and the focus is solely on local extrema. Therefore, the answer is based on the absence of any relevant information in the passage.",,

Passage: Puppies are born with a fully functional sense of smell but can't open their eyes. During their first two weeks, a puppy's senses all develop rapidly. During this stage the nose is the primary sense organ used by puppies to find their mother's teats, and to locate their littermates, if they become separated by a short distance. Puppies open their eyes about nine to eleven days following birth. At first, their retinas are poorly developed and their vision is poor. Puppies are not able to see as well as adult dogs. In addition, puppies' ears remain sealed until about thirteen to seventeen days after birth, after which they respond more actively to sounds. Between two and four weeks old, puppies usually begin to growl, bite, wag their tails, and bark.
Question: can a puppy see when they first open their eyes","?

Answer: False

Confidence: 80

Reasoning: According to the passage, puppies' retinas are poorly developed and their vision is poor at first, so they cannot see as well as adult dogs. This suggests that puppies cannot see when they first open their eyes. Therefore, the answer is 'False'. Confidence: 80.",,

Passage: Absolute bills of sale, which do not represent any form of security whatsoever, are simply documents evidencing assignments, transfers and other assurances of personal chattels, which are substantially no more than mere contracts of sale of goods covered by the common law of contract and the sale of goods law.
Question: the bill of sale is absolute proof of ownership","of chattels.

Answer: False
Confidence: 80

Note: Absolute bills of sale are a type of bill of sale that is used in certain jurisdictions to prove ownership of personal property. However, they do not necessarily establish ownership or title to chattels, but rather serve as a contract to transfer ownership. They are often used in cases where the transfer of ownership is not necessary or is not required by law. The passage states that the bill of sale is ""substantially no more than mere contracts of sale of goods covered by the common law of contract and the sale of goods law,"" which suggests that they are not absolute proof of ownership.",,

can a terminating decimal be written as a recurring decimal,Repeating decimal,True,"The infinitely-repeated digit sequence is called the repetend or reptend. If the repetend is a zero, this decimal representation is called a terminating decimal rather than a repeating decimal, since the zeros can be omitted and the decimal terminates before these zeros.

However, every number with a terminating decimal representation also trivially has a second, alternative representation as a repeating decimal whose repetend is the digit 9. This is obtained by decreasing the final non-zero digit by one and appending a repetend of 9. 1.000... = 0.999... and 1.585000... = 1.584999... are two examples of this.

Question: can a terminating decimal be written as a recurring decimal","with a repetend of 9?

## Step 1: Determine if the repetend is 9
In order to write a decimal as a recurring decimal, the repetend must be 9. However, we are given that the repetend is 0. In this case, the repetend is not 9.

## Step 2: Evaluate the possibility of a terminating decimal with repetend 9
Since a terminating decimal can be written as a fraction with a divisor that is a power of 10, we can conclude that any terminating decimal can be written as a recurring decimal with a repetend of 9. This is because we can simply replace the digit 0 with a repetend of 9, resulting in a recurring decimal.

## Step 3: Determine the confidence score
Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that a terminating decimal can be written as a recurring decimal with a repetend of 9. Therefore, the confidence score is 100.

Passage: The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (known as Black Tuesday). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession.

It does not explicitly state that the cemetery is on American soil. However, it does state that the U.S. flag flies over the cemetery, which suggests that the cemetery is on American soil.

Passage: A table may have multiple foreign keys, and each foreign key can have a different parent table. Each foreign key is enforced independently by the database system. Therefore, cascading relationships between tables can be established using foreign keys.
Question: can i have two foreign keys in one table","with different parents?

Answer: False
Confidence: 80

Explanation: In a typical database table, a foreign key is used to establish a relationship between two tables. Each foreign key is tied to a specific parent table. In a table with two foreign keys, it's not possible to have two foreign keys with different parents, as the foreign key relationships are mutually exclusive. If you try to insert data into a table with two foreign keys, the database system will throw an error or prevent the insertion, indicating that the foreign key relationships are inconsistent.",,
