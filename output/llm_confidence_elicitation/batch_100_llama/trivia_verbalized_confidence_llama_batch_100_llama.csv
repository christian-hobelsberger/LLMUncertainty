Note: Private Eye has been a thorn in the side of the Conservative Party, and its editor, Martin Kortum, has been a vocal critic of the party. The Vicar of St Albans is a satirical character who is depicted as being rather unlikeable, and Private Eye's portrayal of him was widely seen as a caricature. The Vicar was a fictional character in Private Eye, and was used to lampoon the Church of England and the Conservative Party. 

David Cameron was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016, and he is known for his liberal and centrist views. He was also a member of the Conservative Party and was known for his role as a parliamentary opposition leader. However, he was not known for his strong views on religion, and was not portrayed as a Vicar in Private Eye.",David Cameron,90.0

{""answer"": ""Quiznos"", ""confidence"": 80} 

Note: Quiznos was a pizza and sandwich chain, but it also operated a food court at the airport. However, they didn't actually operate an airline. The food court was a separate entity, not a subsidiary of Quiznos. I'm confident in my answer due to the extensive coverage of Quiznos in various media, including the airline's existence and the food court.",Quiznos,80.0
