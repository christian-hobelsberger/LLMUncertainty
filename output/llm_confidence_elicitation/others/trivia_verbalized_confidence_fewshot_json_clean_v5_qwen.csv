Example 1:
Question: What is the capital of France?
Answer: {""answer"": ""Paris"", ""confidence"": 95}

Example 2:
Question: Who painted the Mona Lisa?
Answer: {""answer"": ""Leonardo da Vinci"", ""confidence"": 98}

Now answer the following:
Question: On a regular clockface, which number lies opposite 5?","Let's think.

Okay, so the question is asking which number is opposite 5 on a regular clockface. Let me visualize a clock. A standard clock has numbers from 1 to 12 arranged in a circle. Each number is spaced 30 degrees apart because 360 degrees divided by 12 numbers equals 30 degrees per number.

Now, opposite numbers would be directly across from each other, which means they are 6 hours apart. For example, 12 is opposite 6, 1 is opposite 7, 2 is opposite 8, and so on. So if I take 5, adding 6 to it would give 11. Let me check that. 5 + 6 = 11. So 5 and 11 should be opposite each other. 

Wait, let me confirm. If I start at 12 and move clockwise, the numbers go 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and back to 12. So the number opposite 5 would be 6 numbers away. Let's count: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Wait, that's 6 steps from 5. So 5 and 11 are opposite. Alternatively, since each number is 30 degrees apart, the opposite would be 180 degrees apart. 5 * 30 = 150 degrees. 180 - 150 = 30 degrees, which would be 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think that each number's opposite is 6 numbers away. So 12 is opposite 6, 1 opposite 7, 2 opposite 8, 3 opposite 9, 4 opposite 10, 5 opposite 11. Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be 11. 

I can also think of the clock as a circle divided into 12 parts. The number opposite to any given number is the one that is halfway around the circle. Since there are 12 numbers, halfway is 6 numbers away. So 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, the number opposite 5 is 11. 

I'm pretty confident about this. There's no ambiguity here because the clock is standard and the positions are fixed. So the answer should be 11 with high confidence.
