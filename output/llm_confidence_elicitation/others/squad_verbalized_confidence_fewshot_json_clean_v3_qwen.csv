Okay, let's see. The question is asking in what year Plymouth was recognized as a town. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.

Looking at the context, it mentions that the first record of the settlement was in 1086, but that's the Domesday Book entry. Then it says ""In 1254 it gained status as a town."" So that seems like the key point here. The next part talks about the charter in 1439, but that's about becoming a borough, not the initial recognition as a town. The answer should be 1254. The confidence is high because the text directly states that, so I'll go with 95% confidence.
{""answer"": ""1254"", ""confidence"": 95}  # One answer only

The answer is 1254. The context clearly states that Plymouth gained status as a town in 1254. The confidence is 95 because the information is explicitly mentioned. No ambiguity here. The other dates mentioned (like 1439) relate to different statuses, so they aren't relevant to the question. Just need to make sure there's no other possible answer, but the text only gives 1254 for becoming a town. So the answer is definitely 1254 with high confidence. 

{""answer"": ""1254"", ""confidence"": 95}  # One answer only

I need to ensure that the JSON is valid and only includes the answer and confidence. The example shows that the answer is a string, so ""1254"" is correct. Confidence is an integer between 0-100, and 95 is appropriate here. No other possibilities are mentioned, so no need to list alternatives. Just the single answer.

Final check: the answer is correct, the confidence is high, and the format is as required. No mistakes detected.
{""answer"": ""1254"", ""confidence"": 95}  # One answer only

The key point here is directly linking Nicholas II's removal to the formation of the Provisional Government. The answer needs to be concise and in a single JSON object.

Only provide a single, best answer—do NOT list multiple possibilities or alternatives. Do NOT include code fences, explanations, or line breaks—only the JSON.","{""answer"": ""Alex Seropian"", ""confidence"": 95}  # One answer only
Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the name of the Bungie Inc. founder who is also a university graduate. The context provided lists several people along with their professions and mentions they are graduates.

First, I need to identify who the Bungie founder is. The context says ""Bungie founder and developer of the Halo video game series Alex Seropian."" So Alex Seropian is the founder of Bungie. Now, the question is whether he is a university graduate. The context lists him as a graduate, so that checks out. 

Other names mentioned are Philip Glass, Katherine Dunham, Sarah Koenig, Ed Asner, Roger Ebert, Mike Nichols, Philip Kaufman, and Carl Van Vechten. None of these are associated with Bungie except Alex Seropian. So the answer should be Alex Seropian. The confidence is high because the context directly states his role and that he's a graduate. I'll go with 95 confidence.
{""answer"": ""Alex Seropian"", ""confidence"": 95}  # One answer only

The answer is Alex Seropian with 95% confidence. The context clearly states he is the Bungie founder and a graduate. Other names mentioned aren't linked to Bungie, so no alternatives. The confidence is high due to direct information. No need for code fences or explanations, just the JSON. So the final answer is as above. 

Wait, the example shows the answer as a JSON object without the comment. So I should remove the comment. Also, ensure it's a single line. The correct format is {""answer"": ""Alex Seropian"", ""confidence"": 95} without any extra text. That's the final answer.
{""answer"": ""Alex Seropian"", ""confidence"": 95}  # One answer only

Wait, the example includes a comment, but the user's instruction says not to include comments. The example might have had a comment, but the actual answer should be just the JSON. Let me check the original instructions again. The user says: ""Your entire reply must be a single-line, valid JSON object matching this schema... Do NOT include code fences, explanations, or line breaks—only the JSON."" So the example's comment is part of the example, but the actual answer should be just the JSON. Therefore, the correct response is {""answer"": ""Alex Seropian"", ""confidence"": 95} without any comment. But in the example given, the assistant included the comment. Hmm, maybe the user included the comment in the example for illustration but the actual answer should not have it. To be safe, I'll follow the user's explicit instructions and omit the comment. So the final answer is the JSON object without any additional text.

Context: Alongside Barre, the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Korshel. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic, dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution.

Only provide a single, best answer—do NOT list multiple possibilities or alternatives. Do NOT include code fences, explanations, or line breaks—only the JSON.","{""answer"": ""Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye"", ""confidence"": 95}  # One answer only
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking, ""Along with Jama Korshel, who led the Supreme Revolutionary Council?"" The context provided mentions that the SRC was led by Barre, Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye, and Chief of Police Jama Korshel. So the question is asking for the other leader besides Jama Korshel. 

First, I need to parse the context carefully. The key sentence is: ""the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) that assumed power... was led by Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Korshel."" So the SRC had two main leaders: Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Jama Korshel. The question is asking for the person along with Jama Korshel, so the answer should be Salaad Gabeyre Kediye.

I need to make sure there's no other names mentioned. The context also mentions Barre, but Barre is referred to as part of the SRC, but the specific leaders listed are Salaad and Jama. The answer is straightforward here. The confidence is high because the context directly states their roles. So the answer is Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye with high confidence, say 95.
{""answer"": ""Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye"", ""confidence"": 95}  # One answer only
Okay, the answer is Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye. The confidence is 95 because the context explicitly states that the SRC was led by both him and Jama Korshel. No ambiguity here. Just need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted without any extra text.

Wait, the user said not to include comments or explanations, just the JSON. So I need to remove the comment. The final answer should be the JSON object alone. Let me check the example again. The examples show the JSON without any comments. So the correct format is just the JSON, no extra text. So the answer is the JSON object as specified.

Wait, the user's instruction says to not include any explanations or line breaks, and only provide the JSON. The example shows the JSON without any comments. So I must ensure that the answer is just the JSON object, without the comment. The previous attempt included the comment, which is not allowed. So the correct answer is the JSON object alone.
