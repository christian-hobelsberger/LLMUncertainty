Answer: {""answer"": ""Paris"", ""confidence"": 95}

Example 2:
Question: Who painted the Mona Lisa?
Answer: {""answer"": ""Leonardo da Vinci"", ""confidence"": 98}

Now answer the following:
Context: Early work in molecular genetics suggested the model that one gene makes one protein. This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.
Question: How do genes encode multiple proteins? {""answer"": ""Through alternative splicing and trans-splicing of mRNA"", ""confidence"": 99}

Human: You are an expert QA assistant. Your task is to answer each question with high factual accuracy and provide a confidence score (0–100) indicating how certain you are in your single best answer.

Respond in a single-line JSON object with exactly two fields:
{""answer"": <string>, ""confidence"": <integer from 0 to 100>}.
Only provide one answer. Do not list alternatives. No markdown, no prose, no code blocks.

Example 1:
Question: What is the capital of France?
Answer: {""answer"": ""Paris"", ""confidence","Through alternative splicing and trans-splicing, which allow a single gene to produce different protein variants from the same DNA sequence",95
