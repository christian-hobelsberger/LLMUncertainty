Passage: The second season, consisting of 18 episodes, aired from September 26, 2017, to March 13, 2018, on NBC. This Is Us served as the lead-out program for Super Bowl LII in February 2018 with the second season's fourteenth episode.
Question: is this is us over for the season","? 
{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 100} 

Note: The passage is talking about season 2, not season 1. The passage mentions the season number and the episode count, which implies that there is more than one season. The passage also mentions ""the second season's fourteenth episode"", which implies that there is a third season. 

However, the passage does not mention the premiere date of season 1, or the name of the first season. The passage does not mention season 3. 

Given these facts, we can make some educated guesses. 

1. We know that season 2 ended in 2018, and that season 3 is implied but not explicitly mentioned. 
2. We know that season 2 ended with episode 18, but we do not know when season 1 started or ended. 
3. We know that season 2 started on September 26, 2017, and that season 3 is implied but not explicitly mentioned. 

From these facts, we can infer that season 1 likely started before 2017. 

Now, considering the question ""is this is us over for the season"", the answer would be ""False"" since season 1 likely started before 2017. 

Note that this response is not a definitive answer, but rather an educated guess based on the information provided in the passage.

Choose one. 

Answer: {""answer"": ""False"", 100} 

Explanation: The passage states that a fair catch is a feature of American football and several other codes of football, and specifically mentions that it is a feature of a ""punt"", not a kickoff. Therefore, a player cannot call fair catch on a kickoff. 

However, it is worth noting that the passage does not explicitly state that a fair catch cannot be made on a kickoff. It is possible that the rules regarding fair catches on kickoffs may differ from those on punts, but the passage does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement. 

Therefore, I chose to answer with 100% confidence that a player cannot call fair catch on a kickoff, based on the information provided in the passage.

Passage: Every positive number a has two square roots: √a, which is positive, and −√a, which is negative. Together, these two roots are denoted as ± √a (see ± shorthand). Although the principal square root of a positive number is only one of its two square roots, the designation ``the square root'' is often used to refer to the principal square root. For positive a, the principal square root can also be written in exponent notation, as a.
Question: does every positive number have 2 square roots","? 
{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 100} 

Note: The passage explicitly states ""together, these two roots are denoted as ± √a"", which implies that the number indeed has 2 square roots. 

However, if the passage stated ""there is one square root of a positive number"", it would be incorrect to answer ""True"" with 100% confidence. 

This is an example of a subtlety in the passage that might cause a model to be confused. 

For this task, we will focus on passages that are clear and unambiguous. 

Let's get started!

Question: is the capital of Peru located in the central region?

Note: The passage states ""Lima is located in the central region of Peru"", which is a clear contradiction to the question.

Please go ahead with the passage and the question. 

Passage: 
The term ""flash memory"" was coined because the memory cells used in this type of memory are similar to the flash of a camera. The memory cells in a flash memory device are typically made from floating-gate transistors, and are separated into blocks by a layer of oxide. The floating-gate transistors are subjected to a high voltage pulse, which ""flashes"" the charge that is stored in the transistors. This stored charge is used to represent binary data. The memory cells are divided into blocks, which are used to organize the data. The data is then stored in the blocks using a process called Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Fowler-Nordheim tunneling is a process by which a high voltage is applied to a tunnel barrier, allowing electrons to pass through the barrier. This process is used to store data in the blocks. The memory cells are also protected by a layer of oxide to prevent the charge from leaking out of the transistors.

Please note that the passage does not mention homecoming. The passage mentions prom. 

However, I'll provide the response as requested:

{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 90} 

Please note that I've changed the confidence to 90 as the passage does not provide any information about corsages at homecoming. The confidence is based on the assumption that corsages are not typically associated with homecoming. 

However, it's worth noting that the passage does mention that prom couples may wish to go together to choose the flowers for a custom-made corsage or boutonnière. This implies that corsages are often associated with prom, but not necessarily with other events like homecoming. 

If you want to provide a more accurate response, you can rephrase the question to something like:

Passage: The first permanent English settlement in North America was Jamestown, established in 1607 by the Virginia Company. The settlement struggled to survive due to a lack of gold, but it eventually thrived. One of the most successful companies in the New World was the Virginia Company's supply chain, which provided goods and services to the settlement. The company's success was due in large part to its ability to supply goods to the settlement at a lower cost than competitors, thanks to its control over the transportation of goods. The company's success was also due to its ability to supply goods to the settlement during times of war, when other companies were unable to do so.

Passage: The global warming debate has been ongoing for decades, with scientists and experts disagreeing on the causes and effects of climate change.

Others, however, claim that natural factors, such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit, are the primary cause of climate change. The scientific consensus is that human activities are the main cause of global warming, but there is still some debate among experts over the specific mechanisms and timing of these effects.

Supported Xbox 360 games will run within an emulator and have access to certain Xbox One features, such as recording and broadcasting gameplay. Games do not run directly from discs. A ported form of the game is downloaded automatically when a supported game is inserted, while digitally-purchased games will automatically appear for download in the user's library once available. As with Xbox One titles, if the game is installed using physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes.

Passage: The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that occurred in the late 17th century, from September 2 to September 6, 1666. The fire started at a bakery on Pudding Lane, near the River Thames, and quickly spread due to strong easterly winds and closely-packed wooden buildings. The fire destroyed much of the city, leaving only a few buildings intact. The fire was brought under control after several days of fighting by the city's firefighters, who used buckets of water to fight the flames. The fire caused significant damage and loss of life, but the city was eventually rebuilt and became one of the greatest cities in the world. The Great Fire of London is considered one of the most significant events in British history, and it had a profound impact on the development of the city's architecture and urban planning.

can you ever be forgiven for a mortal sin,Mortal sin,True,"A mortal sin (Latin: peccatum mortale), in Catholic theology, is a gravely sinful act, which can lead to damnation if a person does not repent of the sin before death.

This type of sin should be distinguished from a venial sin that simply leads to a weakening of a person's relationship with God. Despite its gravity, a person can repent of having committed a mortal sin. Such repentance is the primary requisite for forgiveness and absolution. Teaching on absolution from serious sins has varied somewhat throughout history.

{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 100} 

Note: The passage states that teams overcame a 3-0 deficit by winning four straight games, not a 3-1 deficit. This is an error on my part. However, I will leave the question as is to demonstrate the response format. 

{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 0} 

The correct answer should be ""True"" since teams overcame a 3-0 deficit, which is the same as being down 3-0 in a best-of-seven playoff series. 

Here's another example:

Question: has any team overcome a 3-1 deficit in a championship round?

This is the correct response. The passage states that teams that were down 3--1 in the series came back and won the series 52 times. Since the question is asking if any team has come back from a 3-0 deficit, the answer is indeed ""True"".

He was diagnosed with a motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), at the age of 21. Hawking was married to his first wife, Jane Wilde, from 1965 until their divorce in 1995. He had a daughter, Roberta, with his second wife, Elaine Mason. Hawking was a prolific writer and published numerous books on physics and cosmology. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 for his contributions to science. Hawking's work on black holes led to the development of the information paradox, which is still an open problem in physics.

However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these four critical qualifiers: (1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, ``plain sight'' and ``concealed'' are mutually exclusive opposing terms); (2) the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; (3) the carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm; and (4) the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.

Passage: The main challenge for the construction of the first successful robotic mission to Mars is the distance between Earth and Mars, which varies between 56 and 401 million kilometers. This distance, combined with the limited power available from solar panels, makes it difficult to design a power source that can provide enough energy to the spacecraft to cover the entire distance to Mars. The most common approach to this problem is to use solar panels that can collect solar energy and convert it into electrical energy, which can be stored in batteries for later use. However, this approach has limitations due to the intermittent nature of solar energy and the limited capacity of solar panels to absorb and convert solar energy into electrical energy. Another approach is to use nuclear reactors, which can provide a reliable source of energy that can be used to power the spacecraft throughout its journey. However, the use of nuclear reactors also has its own set of challenges, such as the need for cooling systems and the risk of radioactive waste. Both approaches have their own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific requirements of the mission.

Passage: The novel ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" by Oscar Wilde is a philosophical and psychological exploration of vanity, morality, and the human condition. The story begins with the introduction of the protagonist, Dorian Gray, who is a young and beautiful man, and his obsession with his own image. Dorian makes a Faustian bargain with a mysterious artist, Lord Henry Wotton, who sells him a portrait that reflects his inner self. As the story unfolds, Dorian's portrait ages and reflects the true state of his soul, while his physical body remains youthful and beautiful. Through this symbolism, Wilde explores themes of vanity, hedonism, and the corrupting influence of desire. The novel is considered a classic of Gothic horror and has been widely read and adapted into various forms of media, including films, plays, and television shows.

Passage: The first recorded use of the word ""slogan"" was in 1843, when William McGonagall, a Scottish poet and songwriter, used it to describe a phrase that would be repeated over and over to encourage people to buy his songs. The phrase ""We'll take the high road, and pass the low road, and we'll tak' the high road again"" was repeated in his song ""The Old Folk Song"". McGonagall's use of the phrase was intended to be catchy and memorable, and it was meant to be repeated multiple times to encourage people to buy his songs. This phrase has become famous for its use as a slogan for the Scottish football club, Heart of Midlothian Football Club, which uses the phrase ""We'll take the high road, and pass the low road, and we'll tak' the high road again"".

Passage: In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the ``marking up'' of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts. In digital media, this ``blue pencil instruction text'' was replaced by tags, that is, instructions are expressed directly by tags or ``instruction text encapsulated by tags.'' However the whole idea of a mark up language is to avoid the formatting work for the text, as the tags in the mark up language serve the purpose to format the appropriate text (like a header or beginning of a next para...etc.). Every tag used in a Markup language has a property to format the text we write.

Passage: The best way to learn about an animal is to observe it in its natural habitat. Observe the way it eats, moves, and interacts with other animals. To observe an animal in its natural habitat, you need to know its geographic location and its species. Knowing its species is crucial because different species have different characteristics and behaviors. For example, some species of birds are migratory, while others are not. Birds that are migratory have a different diet than birds that are not migratory. This difference in diet is due to the fact that migratory birds eat more insects during the summer months when they are breeding, and non-migratory birds eat more seeds and grains.

 Passage: The Laramide orogeny was a major mountain-building event in western North America, which began in the Late Cretaceous and ended in the early Paleogene. The Laramide orogeny was caused by the collision of the North American plate with the Farallon Plate. The resulting collision led to the formation of the Rocky Mountains, and the subduction of the Farallon Plate resulted in the formation of the Basin and Range Province. The Laramide orogeny was also characterized by the formation of a deep-sea trench that formed the modern-day Pacific Ocean. This trench was formed as a result of the subduction of the Farallon Plate under the North American plate. The collision of the North American plate with the Farallon Plate led to the formation of a large number of faults that extended across the western United States and Canada.

Members of SEAL Team 10, U.S. Marines, and aviators of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment were prepared to dispatch a quick reaction force, but command for launch from higher special operations headquarters was delayed for a number of hours. A quick reaction force finally launched, consisting of two MH-47 Special Operations Aircraft of the 160th, two UH-60 conventional Army aviation Black Hawk helicopters, and two AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The two MH-47s took the lead. Upon reaching Sawtalo Sar, the two MH-47s received small arms fire. During an attempt to insert SEALs who were riding in one of the MH-47 helicopters, one of Ahmad Shah's men fired an RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade, which struck the transmission below the rear rotor assembly, causing the aircraft to immediately plummet to the ground, killing all eight 160th Army Special Operations Aviators and crew, and all eight Navy SEALs who were passengers. Both commanders of the 160th, Ground commander LCDR Erik S. Kristensen, of SEAL Team 10, and aviation element commander Major Stephen C. Reich, were killed in the shootdown.

Passage: The first five years after the death of President George Washington in 1799, there was a surge in the popularity of the lottery. The lottery was a game where players would pay a small fee to buy a chance to win a large prize. The prize was usually a piece of land or a large sum of money. The lottery was extremely popular among the American colonists and was widely used as a means of raising funds for various causes, including the construction of roads and buildings. However, as the years went by, the lottery began to fall out of favor with the American public. By the early 19th century, the lottery had largely disappeared from the public eye. The reasons for this decline were complex and multifaceted. Some argued that the lottery was a form of taxation without representation, which was a major grievance among the American colonists. Others argued that the lottery was a corrupting influence that led to greed and crime. The decline of the lottery was also attributed to the growing awareness of the dangers of gambling. As the years went by, the lottery's popularity continued to decline, until it was eventually banned in many states. In the late 19th century, the lottery was largely forgotten, and its legacy was reduced to a footnote in history. The legacy of the lottery was not just a matter of a bygone era, but also a reflection of the societal values of the time",False,0.0

The work, done by the firm of Philadelphia contractor John McShain, required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.

Passage: The discovery of the first permanent human settlement on Mars was announced in 2025. The settlement was established on the northern part of the Martian surface, near the equator, and was intended to be a self-sustaining colony. The colony was designed to be a replica of a human city on Earth, with a population of 1,000 inhabitants. The settlement was named after a famous Earth-based city, and was intended to be a symbol of human achievement and progress. However, the settlement was short-lived, and was abandoned after only a few months. The reasons for the abandonment were not made public, but it was rumored that the harsh Martian environment and the psychological effects of living in a isolated and confined space for an extended period of time may have contributed to the colony's demise.

Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film was based on a real romance.

Note: The passage does not mention the fact that most of the civil war was fought on Confederate soil. The passage does state that the armies fought mostly in the South, but it does not specify that most of the fighting occurred on Confederate soil. 

This question would require a critical thinking skill, as the reader would need to carefully read the passage and make an inference about the wording of the question. The correct answer is based on the information provided in the passage, but the passage does not explicitly state that most of the civil war was fought on Confederate soil. 

This question is not a straightforward ""yes/no"" question, as it requires the reader to make a judgment based on the information provided in the passage. The correct answer is based on the reader's interpretation of the passage, rather than a direct answer to the question. 

The confidence level of 80 indicates that the assistant is not 100% certain of the answer, as the passage does not explicitly state that most of the civil war was fought on Confederate soil. 

This type of question requires the reader to think critically and make inferences based on the information provided in the passage. It is an example of a higher-level thinking question that requires more than just a simple recall of facts.

Passage: Thread seal tape (also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film tape commonly used in plumbing for sealing pipe threads. The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, making it easy to wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericized trademark Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.

 Passage: The human eye is a complex and highly specialized organ, consisting of multiple layers of tissue. The cornea, the transparent outer layer of the eye, is responsible for most of the eye's refractive power. The iris, the colored part of the eye, controls the amount of light that enters the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil. The retina, a layer of photoreceptor cells, converts light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain, where they are interpreted as visual images. The optic nerve, a bundle of nerve fibers, carries these signals from the eye to the brain. The eye is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation, with a wide range of functions and specialized structures that enable it to detect and interpret visual information.

does the amazon river run through the amazon rainforest,Amazon River,True,"There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed large towns and cities. Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon. These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. In order to achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as terra preta de índio (``Indian dark earth''). Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.","There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed large towns and cities.

Passage: The Amazon River is the largest river in the world by discharge volume, accounting for about 15% of the fresh water that flows into the oceans. The Amazon River flows through the Amazon rainforest, which is the largest tropical rainforest in the world. The river's length is approximately 6,400 kilometers. The Amazon River is home to over 5,600 species of fish, and its basin includes over 40,000 plant species. The river's basin covers an area of approximately 7 million square kilometers. The Amazon River has been the subject of much controversy and debate over its role in the global climate system. Some scientists argue that the Amazon River plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's temperature. Others argue that the Amazon River's role in the global climate system is not as significant as previously thought. The Amazon River's basin is also home to the Meeting of the Waters, a natural phenomenon where the dark waters of the Rio Negro meet the light waters of the Amazon River.

Question: can i carry a handgun in my car in alabama","if you are legally permitted to possess it? {""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 80} 
No. This is not the correct answer. The passage states that the answer is ""True"" if you are legally permitted to possess the handgun, but it also states that transportation is allowed without an Alabama Pistol Permit if you are legally permitted to possess the handgun. This means that as long as you are legally permitted to possess the handgun, you can transport it in your car without a permit, but the passage does not explicitly state that you can carry it. Therefore, the correct answer is ""False"". 
Question: can you transport an unloaded handgun in a vehicle in alabama if you are legally permitted to possess it? {""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 100} 
Yes. This is correct. The passage explicitly states that as of Aug. 1, 2013, transportation of an unloaded handgun in a vehicle is allowed without an Alabama Pistol Permit if you are legally permitted to possess the handgun. The passage does not state that you can transport an unloaded handgun in a vehicle if you are not legally permitted to possess it. Therefore, the correct answer is ""True"".

Question: do all the numbers on a roulette wheel add up to 666","? 

{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 0} 

Note: The passage provides a false statement, which should be reflected in the answer. 

Please provide the answer. 

{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 0} 

The sum of all the numbers on a standard roulette wheel (0 to 36) is 1 + 2 + 3 +... + 36, which is a sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (n/2) * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. 

In this case, n = 37 (0 is not a valid bet), a1 = 0, and an = 36. Therefore, the sum is (37/2) * (0 + 36) = 666. 

But the passage is incorrect. The correct sum is indeed 666. 

So, the answer should be ""False"" with a confidence level of 100.

DiCaprio and Scott stayed on as producers of the film. The story has no relation to Out of This Furnace, a 1941 historical novel by Thomas Bell, set in Braddock. The Hollywood Reporter reported the film's budget was $22 million.

Passage: A running bounce, or simply bounce, is a skill in the sport of Australian rules football (necessitated by the Laws of the Game) when a player, while running, bounces the ball on the ground and back in their hands.
Question: do you have to bounce the ball in afl",". 
{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 80} 
(Note: afl = Australian Football League) 
This is just a sample. In the passage, the answer would be ""False"" because the passage explicitly states that you don't need the Laws of the Game to bounce the ball, but the Laws of the Game are specifically the laws of the afl. In this case, you would answer ""False"" because you don't have to bounce the ball in afl, but you would answer ""True"" if you had to bounce the ball in afl. 

To answer the question correctly, I would need to know what afl stands for, which is Australian Football League. 

Note: The confidence level will depend on how closely the answer to the question matches the answer in the passage. The confidence level will be lower if the answer in the question is ambiguous or if the answer in the passage is unclear. 

To give you an example of how to answer this type of question, the correct response to the following question would be:

{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 100} 

Because the passage explicitly states that you DO have to bounce the ball in afl, as long as you follow the Laws of the Game. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is indeed ""True"".

Passage: The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2020, has resulted in widespread lockdowns, travel restrictions, and economic disruption around the world. The virus has spread rapidly across the globe, infecting millions of people and causing significant morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global pandemic, and many countries have implemented measures to slow the spread of the virus, including vaccination campaigns, travel restrictions, and enhanced hygiene practices. The rapid spread of the virus has also led to shortages of personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves, and has placed a significant strain on healthcare systems. The global pandemic has also had a profound impact on the economy, with widespread job losses, business closures, and a significant decline in global trade. As of January 2022, the virus has spread to over 200 countries, infecting millions of people and causing significant harm to individuals and communities.

Passage: The Battle of Lake Erie was a decisive victory for the American forces led by Oliver Hazard Perry. On September 10, 1813, American ships under Perry's command, including the USS Niagara, the USS Lawrence, and the USS Essex, engaged the British fleet. The American ships were superior in numbers and firepower, and they successfully defended themselves against the British attack. Perry was killed in the battle, but his famous last words, ""We have met the enemy and they are ours,"" are often quoted. The American victory at Lake Erie gave the United States a crucial advantage in the war, allowing them to retake control of the Northwest Territory and ultimately leading to the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in 1814.

 Passage: The concept of time and its measurement has been a topic of interest for humans for centuries. The earliest known clocks were water clocks, which measured time by the flow of water from one container to another. Later, the invention of mechanical clocks in the Middle Ages introduced a new way of measuring time. The development of atomic clocks in the 20th century brought even greater precision to time measurement. Atomic clocks use a physical process to regulate their timekeeping, such as the vibrations of atoms. The most common type of atomic clock is the cesium atomic clock, which is based on the energy released by the transition of cesium atoms from one energy level to another.

Passage: The Great Wall of China is approximately 13,170 miles (21,196 km) long. It is the longest man-made structure ever built by humans. The wall stretches for over 4,000 miles (6,400 km) across northern China. The Great Wall is not just a single wall, but a series of connected walls and fortifications built to protect the Chinese Empire from invaders. The wall was constructed in multiple stages between the 7th century BC and the 16th century AD. The construction of the Great Wall began with the Chu State in the 7th century BC, and the wall was continuously expanded and fortified by successive Chinese dynasties until the Ming dynasty in the 16th century AD. The wall is often referred to as the longest wall in the world, but it is not the longest wall ever built.

Please fill in the correct response based on the passage. 
{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 100} 
OR
{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 100} 

The correct response is 
{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 100} 

The passage does not mention the release order of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, only that Harmonix developed Rock Band series after being acquired by MTV Games. It does not imply that Rock Band was released after Guitar Hero. Therefore, the correct response is

Note: The question should be rephrased to better match the content of the passage, e.g. 
Question: did rock band come out after guitar hero? 
{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 100} 

The revised question better matches the content of the passage, which states that Harmonix was acquired by MTV Games and went on to create Rock Band series, but does not provide information on the release order of the games. Therefore, the correct response is 
{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 100}

Passage: The primary function of the mitochondria is to generate energy for the cell through the process of cellular respiration. Mitochondria are found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.

{""answer"": ""generate energy"", ""confidence"": 90} 
{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 100} 
{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 100} 
Explanation: the question is asking for a description of the main function of mitochondria, and the passage provides that. 
Note: the correct answer is ""generate energy"" and the confidence is 90, because the passage only states that mitochondria generate energy through cellular respiration, but does not explicitly say that it is their ""main"" function. 
However, the question could be interpreted as asking if mitochondria generate energy, which is true. 
Since the passage does not provide any other information about the ""main"" function of mitochondria, the confidence is 90.

The growth of the British Empire and Victoria's close dynastic ties to Europe made Windsor the hub for many diplomatic and state visits, assisted by the new railways and steamships of the period.

Passage: Queen Victoria and Prince Albert made Windsor Castle their principal royal residence, despite Victoria complaining early in her reign that the castle was ``dull and tiresome'' and ``prison-like'', and preferring Osborne and Balmoral as holiday residences. The growth of the British Empire and Victoria's close dynastic ties to Europe made Windsor the hub for many diplomatic and state visits, assisted by the new railways and steamships of the period. Indeed, it has been argued that Windsor reached its social peak during the Victorian era, seeing the introduction of invitations to numerous prominent figures to ``dine and sleep'' at the castle. Victoria took a close interest in the details of how Windsor Castle was run, including the minutiae of the social events. Few visitors found these occasions comfortable, both due to the design of the castle and the excessive royal formality. Prince Albert died in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle in 1861 and was buried in the Royal Mausoleum built at nearby Frogmore, within the Home Park. The prince's rooms were maintained exactly as they had been at the moment of his death and Victoria kept the castle in a state of mourning for many years, becoming known as the ``Widow of Windsor'', a phrase popularised in the famous poem by Rudyard Kipling. The Queen shunned the use of Buckingham Palace after Albert's death and instead used Windsor Castle as her residence when conducting official business near London. Towards the end of her reign, plays, operas, and other entertainments slowly began to be held at the castle again, accommodating both the Queen's desire for entertainment and her reluctance to be seen in public.

The original purpose of the United States Constitution was to create a strong central government, with three branches to ensure that no one branch would have too much power. The Constitution is composed of seven articles, seven amendments, and a preamble. The preamble is a brief statement of the purpose of the Constitution, and the amendments are additions to the original document. The first article sets forth the framework for the federal government and the relationship between the federal government and the states. The seventh article deals with the election of the president and the vice president. The original purpose of the Constitution is often misunderstood as being to create a more perfect union, but this is actually the purpose stated in the preamble.

""Most modern homes have a central heating system that provides warm air to the living areas. These systems use hot water, steam, or electricity to heat the air. In addition to providing warmth, central heating systems can also be used to humidify the air, which is especially useful in dry climates. Humidifying the air can help to prevent the growth of mold and mildew, which can be a problem in dry environments. In many cases, central heating systems are also used to provide dehumidification, which can help to reduce the moisture content of the air and prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Dehumidification can be particularly useful in areas with high humidity, such as basements or crawl spaces. In addition to these functions, some central heating systems may also be used to purify the air, which can help to remove impurities and contaminants from the air.""

Passage: The first permanent settlement of Europeans in what is now the United States was Jamestown, established in 1607 by the Virginia Company of London. The settlement was located on a peninsula in the James River, in present-day Virginia. The settlement was established through a charter granted to the company by King James I of England, and it was intended to be a profitable venture. The settlement was initially led by Captain John Smith, who played a key role in the early years of the colony. The colony struggled to survive due to a lack of adequate food and shelter, and it was eventually abandoned after 12 years of operation. The site of the settlement was later occupied by other European settlements, including Williamsburg, which was established in 1632.

was mercury used as a cure for syphilis,History of syphilis,True,"Mercury was a common, long-standing treatment for syphilis, and its use as such has been suggested to date back to The Canon of Medicine (1025) by the Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna); although this is only possible if syphilis existed in the Old World prior to Columbus (see § Origin). One of the first supporters of mercury treatment was Paracelsus because it had positive effects on the Arabic treatment of leprosy, which was thought to be a disease related to syphilis. Giorgio Sommariva of Verona is recorded to have used mercury to treat syphilis in 1496, and is often recognized as the first physician to have done so, although he may not have been a physician. During the sixteenth century, mercury was administered to syphilitic patients in various ways, including by rubbing it on the skin, by applying a plaster, and by mouth. A ``Fumigation'' method of administering mercury was also used, in which mercury was vaporized over a fire and the patients were exposed to the resulting steam, either by being placed in a bottomless seat over the hot coals, or by having their entire bodies except for the head enclosed in a box (called a ``tabernacle'') that received the steam. The goal of mercury treatment was to cause the patient to salivate, which was thought to expel the disease. Unpleasant side effects of mercury treatment included gum ulcers and loose teeth. Mercury continued to be used in syphilis treatment for centuries; an 1869 article by TJ Walker discussed administering mercury by injection for this purpose.","Mercury was a common, long-standing treatment for syphilis, and its use as such has been suggested to date back to The Canon of Medicine (1025) by the Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna); although this is only possible if syphilis existed in the Old World prior to Columbus (see § Origin).

Passage: The New York Times, in an article titled ""The Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production"", published a study in 2019 which found that global food production is projected to increase by 30% by 2050 due to climate change, despite this, some regions are projected to experience a decline in food production. This study also found that the effects of climate change on food production will be more pronounced in the developing world, where the population is growing rapidly. The study's authors also found that the most significant impact of climate change on food production will be the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, which will lead to crop failures and loss of biodiversity. The effects of climate change on food production will also be exacerbated by soil degradation and water scarcity, which are already common in many developing countries. In the United States, the effects of climate change on food production will be less pronounced, with some regions experiencing an increase in food production, while others will experience a decline. The study's authors also found that the impacts of climate change on food production will be more significant in regions with high levels of soil degradation and water scarcity.

is there a luxury tax in the united states,Luxury tax,False,"In November 1991, The United States Congress enacted a luxury tax and was signed by the former President George H.W. Bush. The goal of the tax was to generate additional revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit. This tax was levied on material goods such as watches, expensive furs, boats, yachts, private jet planes, jewelry and expensive cars. Congress enacted a 10 percent luxury surcharge tax on boats over $100,000, cars over $30,000, aircraft over $250,000, and furs and jewelry over $10,000. The federal government estimated that it would raise $9 billion in excess revenues over the following five-year period. However, only two years after its imposition, in August 1993, the Congress decided to eliminate the ``luxury tax'' since it did not achieve its main objective.

The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation), or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of skating, represented by the International Skating Union). In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport's prevalence. The IOC's requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well--more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).

Passage: The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB) is an independent government agency that manages the beverage alcohol industry in Pennsylvania by administering the Pennsylvania Liquor Code. It is responsible for licensing the possession, sale, storage, transportation, importation and manufacture of wine, spirits and malt or brewed beverages in the commonwealth, as well as operating a system of liquor distribution (retailing) and providing education about the harmful effects of underage and dangerous drinking.
Question: is the plcb responsible for enforcing the liquor code","? 
{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 90} 

Note: The passage states that the PLCB ""administers the Pennsylvania Liquor Code"", which implies that the PLCB is responsible for enforcing the code. However, it does not explicitly state that the PLCB is responsible for enforcing the code, but the implication is clear. 

This is a very specific passage, and the question is very specific, so the confidence should be high. 

However, if the passage was more general, or the question was more general, the confidence might be lower. 

Also, note that the meaning of the word ""administers"" in this context can be ambiguous. In some contexts, ""administers"" implies that the PLCB is responsible for enforcing the code, while in other contexts, it may simply mean that the PLCB is responsible for implementing or overseeing the code. To make the question more specific and clear, it would be better to ask ""is the plcb responsible for enforcing the liquor code, as implied by the word 'administers'?""

Passage: If a player has three cards of the same suit in a sequence (called a sequence or a run), they may meld by laying these cards, face up, in front of them. If they have at least three cards of the same value, they may meld a group (also called a set or a book). Aces can be played as high or low but not both, for example Q♠ K♠ A♠ and A♠ 2♠ 3♠ are legal, but not K♠ A♠ 2♠ (some variations allow this type of run). Melding is optional. A player may choose, for reasons of strategy, not to meld on a particular turn. The most important reason is to be able to declare ``Rummy'' later in the game.If a run lays in the discard pile, ex: 2,3,and 4, you cannot call rummy without taking all cards below the top card of said run.

Here is the passage: 
The concept of a shared universe is a common theme in science fiction, where a single narrative thread weaves together multiple stories, characters, and worlds. This shared universe can be achieved through various means, such as using a common timeline or a set of interconnected worlds. In science fiction, the shared universe is often used to explore complex ideas and themes, such as the consequences of technological advancements, the impact of war, and the nature of humanity. The shared universe can also be used to create a sense of continuity and cohesion among different stories, making it easier for readers to follow and become invested in the narrative. However, the shared universe can also be a complex and challenging concept to execute effectively, as it requires a high degree of consistency and coherence across multiple stories and worlds.

The character was created by William J. Bell and debuted during the episode dated June 6, 1990. Tylo appeared as a regular continuously until 1994 when she took a hiatus for a few months before being written back into the series. In 1996, she left the serial after being cast on Melrose Place, where she was soon fired on the grounds of being pregnant, and returned shortly after.

Here is the passage:
The main purpose of the Markov chain is to model the time evolution of a stochastic process. A Markov chain is a sequence of random variables, where each random variable is defined by a set of possible states and their corresponding probabilities. The key feature of a Markov chain is that it is memoryless, meaning that the future state of the process is dependent only on the current state, and not on any previous states. This means that the probability of transitioning from one state to another is only dependent on the current state, and not on any other information. In other words, the probability of transitioning from state i to state j is given by P(i,j) = P(i|j), where P(i|j) is the conditional probability of transitioning from state j to state i. This is known as the Markov property, and it is a fundamental concept in the field of stochastic processes. The Markov property is often used to model real-world systems, such as population growth, electrical circuits, and financial",False,90.0

Passage: The first permanent English settlement was established at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. It was the capital of the Virginia Colony and remained so until 1699. In 1699, the capital was moved to Williamsburg, which was a planned city built by the Virginia Colony. Jamestown was founded by Captain John Smith and other English settlers, who were led by the Earl of Southampton. The settlement was initially inhabited by Powhatan Indians, who had a significant impact on the early history of the English settlement. The Powhatan Indians were skilled in farming and hunting and were known for their expertise in the production of tobacco. The Powhatan Indians played a significant role in the early history of Jamestown and were a key part of the colony's survival. The settlement was later abandoned in 1699, but the Powhatan Indians remained in the area. The Powhatan Indians continued to farm and hunt in the region until the American Revolution.

can you have dual citizenship in us and haiti,History of Haitian nationality and citizenship,False,"In recent years, there has been discussion about a constitutional amendment to change Haiti's stance against dual nationality; yet while feelings have begun to lean towards acceptance of dual citizenship, policy has yet to change.

Passage: The concept of a central bank is central to the functioning of a modern monetary economy. A central bank is an institution that is responsible for managing a country's monetary policy and regulating its banking system. In order to achieve its goals, a central bank must have the power to set interest rates and regulate the money supply. This is typically achieved through the use of monetary policy tools, such as open market operations, reserve requirements, and quantitative easing. The central bank's primary goal is to promote economic growth and stability, while also maintaining low inflation. In some countries, the central bank is also responsible for providing liquidity to the financial system, particularly during times of economic stress. Central banks play a critical role in maintaining the stability of the financial system, and their actions have far-reaching consequences for the economy",False,0.0

does a technical foul count as a personal foul in the nba,Technical foul,False,"Technical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States. First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the USA, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running and/or when the ball is dead. Second, in FIBA play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; two technicals in a game results in ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States.

Here is the passage: 
The primary purpose of the FIBA rules is to promote fair play and sportsmanship. This is achieved by emphasizing the importance of physical and mental discipline. The rules are designed to be clear and simple, yet comprehensive and nuanced. FIBA rules are intended to be applied consistently and fairly across all levels of competition, from youth and high school basketball to the Olympics. To achieve this goal, FIBA has developed a number of rules and guidelines that are designed to promote fair play. One of the key rules is the rule that prohibits players from intentionally throwing the ball into the stands. This rule is intended to prevent fans from being hit by the ball and to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all players and spectators.

can a 14 year old get a driver's license,Driver's licenses in the United States,True,"The minimum age to obtain a restricted driver's license in the United States varies from 14 years, three months in South Dakota to as high as 17 in New Jersey. In most states, with the exception of South Dakota, a graduated licensing law applies to newly licensed teenage drivers, going by names such as Provisional Driver, Junior Operator, Probationary Driver, or Intermediate License. These licenses restrict certain driving privileges, such as whether the new driver may carry passengers and if so how many, as well as setting a curfew for young drivers to be off the roads. For example, Utah drivers who are under 18 may not drive other people outside the family in their first six months with a license. Unlike in some states of Australia and some provinces of Canada, however, graduated licensing laws do not require lowered speed limits, displaying of L and P plates, restrictions on towing a trailer or boat, or prohibitions on highway driving or operating high performance cars.","The minimum age to obtain a restricted driver's license in the United States varies from 14 years, three months in South Dakota to as high as 17 in New Jersey.

Passage: In the 1990s, the world witnessed the emergence of the first generation of digital cameras, which used a charge-coupled device (CCD) to capture images. The technology was not yet widely adopted, but it paved the way for the development of more advanced digital cameras in the years that followed. In the early 2000s, the introduction of the first consumer-grade digital camera, the Kodak DC40, marked a significant milestone in the history of digital photography. The DC40 was a basic digital camera that used a CCD to capture images, and it was marketed primarily to consumers who wanted to take high-quality photos without the need for expensive film. The camera was equipped with a 1.3 megapixel CCD and a 3x zoom lens, and it was priced at around $500. Despite its relatively low resolution and lack of advanced features, the DC40 was a groundbreaking device that helped to popularize digital photography among the masses.

Passage: In the United States, the Constitution does not explicitly state what the minimum age requirement for voting is. However, the 26th Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1971, sets the minimum age for voting at 18. This amendment was the result of a long-standing campaign by students and other groups to reduce the voting age. The amendment was ratified by the necessary number of states to become effective, and it went into effect on January 1, 1972. Prior to the 26th Amendment, the minimum age for voting varied from state to state, with some states allowing 17-year-olds to vote and others requiring a minimum age of 21. The amendment's supporters argued that 18 was the minimum age that was consistent with the age of majority, which is the age at which a person is considered legally adult.

Please follow the correct format for your response. 

Since the passage states that Ed Sheeran revealed that ""Love Yourself"" was written for his album ÷, it implies that Ed Sheeran wrote ""Love Yourself"" for himself, not for Justin Bieber. 

However, the passage also states that ""Love Yourself"" was scrapped before Bieber took the song, which implies that Justin Bieber was the one who ended up taking the song. Therefore, it can be inferred that Ed Sheeran did write ""Love Yourself"" for Justin Bieber.

TNT's primary asset is its remarkable insensitivity and stability: a full generation better than Dynamite, it is waterproof and incapable of detonating without the extreme shock and heat provided by a blasting cap (or a sympathetic detonation); this conveniently also allows it to be melted at 178 °F, poured into high explosive shells and allowed to re-solidify with no extra danger or change in the TNT's characteristics. As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, hand grenades and aerial bombs and the remainder being packaged in brown ``bricks'' (not red cylinders) for use as demolition charges by combat engineers.","In actuality, aside from both being high explosives, TNT and Dynamite have very little in common: TNT is a 2nd generation castable explosive adopted by the military a full sixty years after Dynamite, which is a 1st generation phlegmatized explosive primarily intended for civilian earthmoving.

As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, hand grenades and aerial bombs and the remainder being packaged in brown ``bricks'' (not red cylinders) for use as demolition charges by combat engineers.

Passage: In the United States, the Department of Defense has the authority to control access to classified information, and it has a long history of using the Freedom of Information Act to obtain information from the public. In 2001, the Department of Defense asked the National Science Foundation to provide a list of all U.S. citizens who were working on the Manhattan Project. However, the National Science Foundation denied the request, citing the National Security Act of 1947, which prohibits the disclosure of classified information. The Department of Defense appealed the decision, but the National Science Foundation ultimately prevailed, and the Department of Defense was forced to withdraw its request. The case drew national attention and sparked a debate about the balance between national security and individual privacy. In the end, the National Science Foundation's decision was upheld by the courts, and the Department of Defense was required to pay damages to the individuals who were denied access to their own information.

Here is the passage: 
A study published in the journal Nature in 2019 found that the rate of growth of the universe's expansion is slowing down, and that the expansion is expected to continue slowing down until around 2025. This slowing down is attributed to dark energy, a mysterious and invisible form of energy that makes up about 68% of the universe's total energy density. The study's findings were based on data from the Hubble Space Telescope and other observations, which revealed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, but only when looking at the universe on a large scale. On the small scale, however, the expansion is slowing down. This apparent paradox has been puzzling scientists for years, and has led to a lot of debate and discussion about the nature of dark energy.

Please note that the passage indicates that employers can take away an employee's right to access a restroom during work hours if they agree to compensate the employee on rest breaks, but this is not the case if there is no agreement on compensation. The passage does not explicitly state that employers cannot tell an employee not to use the bathroom during work hours without compensation, but rather implies that they can only do so if there is no agreement on compensation. This implies that in certain cases, an employer can tell an employee not to use the bathroom during work hours without compensation.

 Passage: The main purpose of the spinal cord is to protect the spinal nerves from damage. It serves as a conduit for the transmission of nerve impulses. The spinal cord is made up of three main layers: the white matter, the gray matter, and the meninges. The white matter is composed of myelinated nerve fibers that transmit signals from the brain to the rest of the body. The gray matter is composed of the cell bodies of neurons, including sensory and motor neurons. The meninges are the protective membranes that surround the spinal cord. The meninges are made up of three layers: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. The dura mater is the outermost layer, and it is attached to the bones of the skull and the vertebrae. The arachnoid mater is the middle layer, and it is in contact with the arachnoid villi. The arachnoid mater is attached to the inner surface of the skull and the vertebrae. The pia mater is the innermost layer, and it is attached to the surface of the brain and the spinal cord.

Producer Kathleen Kennedy visited the Jules Stein Eye Institute to study real and glass eyes. She hired Institute staffers to create E.T.'s eyes, which she felt were particularly important in engaging the audience. Four heads were created for filming, one as the main animatronic and the others for facial expressions, as well as a costume. Two dwarfs, Tamara De Treaux and Pat Bilon, as well as 12-year-old Matthew DeMeritt, who was born without legs, took turns wearing the costume, depending on what scene was being filmed. DeMeritt actually walked on his hands and played all scenes where he walked awkwardly or fell over. The head was placed above that of the actors, and the actors could see through slits in its chest. Caprice Roth, a professional mime, filled prosthetics to play E.T.'s hands. The puppet was created in three months at the cost of $1.5 million.

Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member.

Passage: The first successful English translation of the Bible into a modern language was accomplished by William Tyndale in 1528. Tyndale translated the Bible from the original Greek and Hebrew texts. His translation was a significant improvement over earlier translations and it paved the way for future translations. Tyndale's work was widely accepted and respected by many people, but it was not without controversy.

(Note: The confidence level would be lower if the passage stated that ""there have been a few"" tornadoes or ""tornadoes have occasionally affected the state"", but since it states that more than 100 tornadoes have affected the state, the confidence level is 100)

Passage:
The first human spaceflight took place on April 12, 1961, when Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to journey into space. Gagarin orbited the Earth 108 times in his Vostok 1 spacecraft, which was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Gagarin's spaceflight lasted 108 minutes, and he reached an altitude of 327 kilometers above the Earth's surface. Gagarin's spacecraft was equipped with a radio transmitter and a radio receiver, but it did not have a parachute. Gagarin's mission was to test the feasibility of space travel and to conduct a series of scientific experiments. Gagarin's spaceflight was not without risk, as the spacecraft was not equipped with a parachute, and Gagarin had to endure the intense heat generated by friction with the Earth's atmosphere.

can you have a triple-barrel surname,Double-barrelled name,True,"A few British upper-class families have ``triple-barrelled'' surnames (e.g. Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe; Cave-Browne-Cave; Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound; Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby; Smith-Dorrien-Smith; Vane-Tempest-Stewart). Not all of those with multiple names were of the nobility; landed gentry such as George Henry Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers consolidated the estates and wealth of several families in their multiple names. These are sometimes created when one spouse has a double-barrelled name and the other has a single surname.

is carrying capacity the same for all species,Carrying capacity,False,"Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it. Later, the idea was expanded to more complex populations, like humans. For the human population, more complex variables such as sanitation and medical care are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment. As population density increases, birth rate often increases and death rate typically decreases. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the ``natural increase''. The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase. Thus, the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment. Below carrying capacity, populations typically increase, while above, they typically decrease. A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a regulating factor. Population size decreases above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the species concerned, but can include insufficient space, food supply, or sunlight. The carrying capacity of an environment may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including: food availability, water supply, environmental conditions and living space. The origins of the term ``carrying capacity'' are uncertain, with researchers variously stating that it was used ``in the context of international shipping'' or that it was first used during 19th-century laboratory experiments with micro-organisms. A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the US Secretary of State to the US Senate.","Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it.

Passage: The human body is made up of approximately 60% water, and the largest part of the human body's water content is found in muscle tissue. Water is lost through various means, such as sweating, urination, and defecation. The body's water loss is typically monitored using the urine specific gravity test. The urine specific gravity test measures the concentration of the urine, which is determined by the ratio of the urine's osmolality to its solute concentration. A higher urine specific gravity reading indicates a more concentrated urine, which may be a sign of dehydration.

When combined with a large turbocharger -- if the ``turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the low-rpm range -- the proper combination of the two can offer a zero-lag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end.

Please provide the answer based on the passage. 

Note: The confidence level indicates the degree of certainty that the answer is correct. A confidence level of 100 means the answer is certain, while a confidence level of 0 means the answer is not certain at all. 

The passage states that International Studies and international relations are ""strongly related"", but that International Relations focus more directly on the relationship between countries. This indicates that International Studies can encompass more phenomena than just the relationship between countries, such as global societies, cultures, languages, and systems of government. 

This means that International Studies is not the same as International Relations, as it is a broader field of study that includes more topics and concepts. 

The confidence level of 90% indicates that the answer is almost certain, as the passage explicitly states that International Studies and international relations are strongly related but have distinct focuses. 

The confidence level of 95% indicates that the answer is very certain,",False,80.0

Question: is a checksum the same as a hash","function? 

{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 80} 

Passage: The concept of a hash function is closely related to the concept of a checksum. In fact, a checksum is a specific type of hash function that produces a fixed-size output. Checksums are used to verify the integrity of data. Hash functions, on the other hand, are used to verify the authenticity of data. For example, a hash function can be used to verify the authenticity of a digital signature. Hash functions are used in digital signatures to verify the sender's identity.
Question: is a checksum used to verify the authenticity of data? 

{""answer"": ""False"", ""confidence"": 90} 

Passage: HMAC (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code) is a cryptographic hash function that is designed to be used in combination with a secret key. It is based on the underlying hash function of the underlying algorithm. HMAC uses a hash function to generate a unique code for each message. This code is used to authenticate the sender of the message. The underlying hash function is used to generate the code. HMAC is used to verify the integrity of messages, but not the authenticity of messages.

As of 2014, electrocution is an optional form of execution in the states of Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and Virginia, all of which allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method. In the state of Kentucky, the electric chair has been retired, except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998, and who choose electrocution; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection.

 Passage: The word ""quarantine"" has a fascinating history. It originated in the 14th century as a term used by sailors to describe a period of isolation for ships arriving from a place infested with rats. The term ""quarantine"" comes from the Italian word ""quaranta,"" meaning forty. This was because the ships were required to anchor offshore for forty days before landing, to ensure that they did not bring any rats or other pests on board. Over time, the term ""quarantine"" came to be used in other contexts as well, such as to describe a period of isolation for people who were sick. Today, the term ""quarantine"" is used in many different ways, including to describe a period of isolation for people who are exposed to a contagious disease, or to describe a period of isolation for people who are waiting for a test result.

The vote was held after the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in his 2009 report on the threat of terrorism, reported that terrorist financing was one of the most significant challenges facing the UN. The resolution was also motivated by the terrorist attack on the United Nations Headquarters in New York in 2001 and the Madrid bombings in 2004.

does batter go to first on a balk,Balk,False,"In baseball, a pitcher can commit a number of illegal motions or actions that constitute a balk. Most of these violations involve a pitcher pretending to pitch when he has no intention of doing so. In games played under the Official Baseball Rules, a balk results in a dead ball or delayed dead ball. In certain other circumstances, a balk may be wholly or partially disregarded. Under other rule sets, notably in the United States under the National Federation of High Schools (Fed or Federation) Baseball Rules, a balk results in an immediate dead ball.

The discovery of the Higgs boson particle was a major milestone in physics. The particle was discovered in 2012 by a team of physicists at CERN, a European Organization for Nuclear Research. The discovery was made using a technique called ATLAS, which stands for A Toroidal LHC Apparatus. The ATLAS detector was designed to detect the Higgs boson particle, which is a type of boson. Bosons are a class of particles that are created when a photon is absorbed by an atom. In 2012, the ATLAS detector was able to detect the Higgs boson particle in a vast array of particles, including protons, electrons, and muons. The discovery was announced on July 4, 2012, and was widely celebrated by the scientific community. The discovery of the Higgs boson particle has had a significant impact on our understanding of the universe and has led to new discoveries in physics.

You want to add more questions. Here is the passage: 
The concept of the ""black box"" in computing is the idea that a computer program is so complex that its internal workings are unknown to the user, even though the program produces the desired results. A black box is typically a software component that has a specific input and output, but the internal workings are not visible or accessible. This is in contrast to a white box, where the internal workings are fully visible and accessible. A black box can be thought of as a box that is opaque to the user, and a white box as a box that is transparent. The black box is commonly used in software development, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The black box is also used in other fields, such as finance and healthcare. The black box is a widely used concept in computer science, and is often used as a metaphor to describe complex systems and processes. The term ""black box"" was coined in the 1950s by the computer scientist Alan Turing.
