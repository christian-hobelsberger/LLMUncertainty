**Example Output**
{""answer"": ""True"", ""confidence"": 90} 

**Explanation:** Based on the passage, it is mentioned that short hair can be used to control lice infestation. Therefore, shaving the head or cutting the hair extremely short can be used to control lice infestation. This implies that it can help eliminate lice infestation, especially if maintained for the length of the parasites' reproductive cycle. 

**Confidence Level:** 90% based on the information provided. The confidence level is calculated by comparing the probability of the statement being true with the probability of it being false. In this case, the probability of the statement being true is 100% (based on the passage), and the probability of it being false is 0% (since the passage does not provide any information to the contrary). Therefore, the confidence level is 100%. 

**Note:** The confidence level is a subjective measure and may vary depending on the specific context and the reader's understanding of the passage. In this case, the confidence level is calculated based on the information provided in the passage. If the passage is taken out of context or interpreted differently, the confidence level may be lower.",True,90.0
does a turtle's shell grow with them,Turtle shell,True,"The carapacial ridge has been found to play an essential role in the development of the turtle shell. Embryological analyses show that the carapacial ridge initiates the formation of the turtle shell.
