Now answer the following:
Context: Orthodox Judaism holds that the words of the Torah, including both the Written Law (Pentateuch) and those parts of the Oral Law which are ""halacha leMoshe m'Sinai"", were dictated by God to Moses essentially as they exist today. The laws contained in the Written Torah were given along with detailed explanations as how to apply and interpret them, the Oral Law. Although Orthodox Jews believe that many elements of current religious law were decreed or added as ""fences"" around the law by the rabbis, all Orthodox Jews believe that there is an underlying core of Sinaitic law and that this core of the religious laws Orthodox Jews know today is thus directly derived from Sinai and directly reflects the Divine will. As such, Orthodox Jews believe that one must be extremely careful in interpreting Jewish law. Orthodox Judaism holds that, given Jewish law's Divine origin, no underlying principle may be compromised in accounting for changing political, social or economic conditions; in this sense, ""creativity"" and development in Jewish law is limited.

It guarantees that states recognize the validity of each other's legal contracts, marriages, and judgments. Additionally, it guarantees military and civil defense to each state. This section is often referred to as the ""compact theory"" of statehood. The ""compact theory"" is a theory of state relations that suggests that the states are united in their sovereignty, and that each state is a member of a larger political entity, the United States of America. Under this theory, the states are bound together by a system of mutual obligations and responsibilities, and are expected to work together to maintain the integrity of the federal system.
