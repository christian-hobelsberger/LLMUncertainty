57266715dd62a815002e83be,British_Empire,When did England first establish a colony in Guiana?,"The Caribbean initially provided England's most important and lucrative colonies, but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits.
