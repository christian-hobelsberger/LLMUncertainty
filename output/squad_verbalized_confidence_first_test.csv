## Step 1: Understand the definition of Offensive Counterair (OCA).
The definition of OCA is offensive operations to destroy, disrupt, or neutralize enemy aircraft, missiles, launch platforms, and their supporting structures and systems both before and after launch.

## Step 2: Analyze the role of OCA in countering air and missile threats.
OCA is designed to attack the enemy closer to its source, aiming to defeat the enemy before it can launch its threats.

## Step 1: Identify the key concept of lossy audio encoding
Lossy audio encoding is a process where the audio signal is compressed to reduce the amount of data required to represent it, resulting in a smaller file size but potentially a loss of sound quality.

## Step 2: Consider the purpose of setting a bit rate in lossy audio encoding
The bit rate specifies how many kilobits the file may use per second of audio. A higher bit rate typically results in a larger",,
